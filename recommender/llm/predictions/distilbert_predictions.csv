We LOVE this dessert and make it all of the time.  It&#39;s fabulous and turns out great every time!!  Thanks so much for sharing.,2,2,positive
"Delicious and perfect for a cold winter afternoon! I heeded the comments...used 2x more beef, half as much potatoes, and shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta. Hubby bragged at work and I shared the recipe. Definitely making again!",2,2,positive
Looks yummy and healthy food...good idea,2,2,positive
I made this according to the recipe and it was wonderful.  Served it for company.  Everyone loved it.,2,2,positive
"This was great! Full of flavor, and simple to put together. It wasn&#39;t time consuming either! My kids absolutely loved this. We added 100 calorie guacomole also!",2,2,positive

Mmm Mmm GREAT!,2,2,positive
"My 12 year old son gobbled this up.  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the onions, so I&#39;ll make again, but maybe try dried onions next time.  I also only used ketchup on top but were still excellent!!!!!",2,2,positive
"Love how easy this is to make. But... way too sweet at a half a cup of sugar. Also, bake at 350 or 400 like other recipes suggest. After 50 mins at 325, center still jiggles.",2,2,positive
Didn&#39;t last a day at my house!  Excellent recipe!,2,2,positive
"You can also add shredded cheese to the cream cheese &amp; sour cream mixture. Thick shredded gives it texture. I&#39;m going to try the mascarpone &amp; Greek yogurt next time.  Also someone asked why cut the grapes.... you should always cut them, they are a choking Hazzard for elderly and children. Also, out of brown sugar? Make your own.
1 cup granulated sugar 
1 tbs molasses 
Mix, store in a zip lock baggy",2,2,positive
Delicious. Creamy and moist dessert. Love the topping.,2,2,positive
I have made this recipe several times and it is one of my favorite chicken recipes.  The chicken is so tender and the topping of tomatoes and garlic just makes it taste so good.,2,2,positive
"I made this yesterday and it is DELICIOUS! A friend of mine stopped by our house today and tried it, she loved it too and demanded the recipe. I added a little extra celery salt, and a splash of apple cider vinegar. I also wasn&#39;t sure which type of mayo to use, so I used half Hellmans and half Miracle whip. It was simply AMAZING!",2,2,positive
Uber moist and full of strawberry goodness- My mom loved it!!!!,2,2,positive
My family and I enjoyed this.  It was pretty easy and I always have these ingredients on hand.  We will do this again.,2,2,positive
"My husband and I were both skeptical, but this is amazing.",2,2,positive
"When I started making this, I was sure I was going to hate it. ( I didnt even save the recipe. )  To my surprise it was wonderful.  Not too overwhelming  taste of peanut butter .  It was perfect taste of chocolate and peanut butter, still tasting the cheesecake.  I used a package of chocolate Graham crackers instead of oreos. And I drizzled the chocolate fudge topping to make it look like lattice instead of covering it.  no peanut butter cups were needed. It was awesome. Everyone loved it . Definitely 5? took 2 days to find the recipe again but now its saved in 2 places !!!!!",2,2,positive
"Made this cake for my husbands birthday...followed directions exactly as written and it turned out perfectly!  I did not use the frosting, my husband requested a different kind (coconut), but I look forward to trying the frosting out in the future.",2,2,positive
Thick and rich. Really enjoyed as an alternative to a traditional chili,2,2,positive
I add some oatmeal to absorb some of the juice.,2,2,positive
I made this for my husband&#39;s birthday barbecue last month.  We had a few people over and the bowl was empty at the end of the meal.,2,2,positive
"I have been making this for years, it is one of my families favorites. I make it often for company for something different and it always gets rave reviews. Don&#39;t let the different ingredients detour you. It is a flavor combo that is unexpected, delicious and packed full of veggies.",2,2,positive
"I made this for Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit and my daughter requested it for her birthday dinner. I used canned crabmeat instead of the imitation stuff. Even though it was finely shredded it worked extremely well and actually gave some body to the sauce. I also used just a little extra shrimp, scallops and crabmeat. It was fantastic and will be a go-to for special dinners!",2,2,positive
I made this for a family reunion recently and it was a tremendous hit! Used frozen peaches from our own tree and substituted the juice from the peaches  for the water.  Delicious!!!!,2,2,positive
"Loved it.  2nd time I varied the recipe a little: more vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, beat the whites, replaced the white volume with water to make the batter, folded in the whites. It’s just as delicious, but substantially lighter with out losing the creamy ness.",2,2,positive
"This Banana bread is amazing!  I just started working with a toddler that cannot have any gluten, and looking for things that he can enjoy eating.  Did anyone try to make this in cupcake or mini loaf sizes? Do you think that it could work?",2,2,positive
"Jiffy cake mix comes in 9 oz. Have made this cake many time, except I buy pre baked pound cake instead of cake mix. I slice the cake, cover the bottom of glass 9x13 pan then follow the rest of this recipe. Also I do not use the fat-free or sugar-free, but thats just the way I am.",0,2,positive
Oh this was so good!!!  I have had MANY compliments!!!,0,2,positive
Best bars ever. I make these twice a week. One for home and one for work. All my cowokers are always asking for them.,2,2,positive
I don’t usually do reviews but I made this but doubled for my BIG family! And OMG! Absolutely the easiest and best dish! Everyone loved it!!,2,2,positive
So good! I used plain breadcrumbs and had no problem with the consistency. My husband loved it and our 3 year old chowed down as well. Served with mashed potatoes for tasty comfort dinner.,2,2,positive
"This was very good, but I forgot to trim the fat off the chops.  The casserole was a little too greasy.  I&#39;m going to try this with boneless skinless chicken breasts -- has anyone tried this?",2,0,negative
Excellent.   My family  loves this dessert.  They beg for it,0,2,positive
"I agree with some of the other reviewers.  The extra  1/2 tsp of salt is not needed its already salty from the beef broth.  Also I would use corn tortillas, like the texture better, not so soft like the flour.  And I would omit the garlic... to me thats not really authentic Mexican, think I&#39;ll add jalapeno instead. also sauce did taste a bit floury..  Was good, but think I&#39;ll keep looking for a more authentic Mexican recipe. And was not bland at all!!  I dont know where some of these ppl&#39;s taste buds are!",2,1,neutral
This recipe was given to me by a friend. I first made it for a soup and salad day at work.  It was such a hit I make it frequently at home as well.,2,2,positive
"Made this last night for a potluck today.  Everyone loved it-I work with lots of people on &#34;Keto&#34; and I was really glad to find something they could eat without needing to change anything!   Just make sure you get the excess moisture out of the Zucchini, I layer mine on a cookie sheet and dried it out a bit (400 for 10 min) before I cooled and combined it with the egg and cheese)  and you can get it firm without being too dry!",2,2,positive
Very Very good! Even my mother in law who is a VERY tough critic loved it.,2,2,positive
"I had never made this salad before I ate it at a picnic..delicious!  got the recipe and made it the next day, tossed in some chopped apples and chopped celery.  Also, melted the brown sugar and pecans together and poured over top for a crunchy, toffee like topping.",2,2,positive
"I first made this recipe around 10-12 years ago. Everyone that eats these always wants the recipe. My boyfriend will do anything that needs done around the house when I serve him these with a nice fresh salad, garlic bread &amp; some sweet tea lol. Best of all, I don&#39;t even have to ask him ;)Came here today to get the recipe, because I&#39;m making them for him tonight.  He is gonna be so pleased to walk in from work smelling the deliciousness as he enters the door. My mouth is watering just thinking about them simmering mmm mmm. Please do not hesitate on trying this recipe ladies and gents, you will not be disappointed, I promise ya!Thank you so much for the recipe Darlis! You&#39;re an angel. I&#39;m in Wisconsin too. Lived down south the first time I made these. Again I cannot thank you enough for this incredible recipe. You rock Darlis :)",2,2,positive
I made this for our church Mothers Day Dinner.  I did it in 4 small pans and 9 muffin tops.  The all turned out fantastic.  Very moist and didn&#39;t dry out even 2 days later. Will make it again for our bake sale...,2,2,positive
Where does the half n half come in.  I am not seeing any directions for it.,0,0,negative
I love this recipe.  Thank you for posting it.  I turn mine into seafood chowder by adding 2 cans of escargot and tiger shrimp.  I also use my home made bone broths either chicken or turkey as I can control the sodium levels this way.  I  don&#39;t have to add any extra chicken bouillon.  If I need extra salt I add 1/4 tsp of celery salt.  I always have reserve bacon grease so if I don&#39;t have any bacon on hand it has the flavour in the soup already.  It is nice to change it up once in a while.  I also use this recipe for loaded baked potato soup because it so much easier.  Enjoy!,2,2,positive
I made this cake for our church bingo and it was gone in a flash.  We were surprised that people offered to pay  two dollars for a second slice because it was so good.,2,2,positive
These are soooo good. I have made them 4 or 5 times since finding the recipe. Can&#39;t wait to try them with warmed apples slices this fall. This recipe is a &#34;keeper&#34;.,2,2,positive
what is ground mustard please? I have dried mustard powder and mustard with mustard seeds. is either one correct?,0,0,negative
"The texture was soggy, the taste was bland, the sauce only added more sweet to a really sweet cake and then throw in the fat and butter and there was nothing to find tasty.",1,1,neutral
OMG! Made for a bar-b-que.... ALL I HAVETO SAY IS EVERYONE WAS ASKING 4 THE RECIPE. THEY LASTED A WHOLE HR ON TABLE... FRIENDS WANTED MORE LOL I MADE 3 BATCHES FOR 30 PEOPLE ..,2,2,positive
"This was an instant favorite! Instead of the cookie crust, I broke up some leftover brownies. I also layered mine in a clear, glass bowl, alternating each layer at least twice...it just dressed it up a little and added some eye-appeal.",2,2,positive
Marvelous!,2,2,positive
This was very delicious.  I used organic chicken breast tenderloins.,2,2,positive
Best banana bread ever. Used pecans instead of walnuts as a preference. Took about 1:23 in a gas range. Perfect.,2,2,positive
"This is a great recipe especially for the appealing &#34;stick to veg&#34; texture of dressing. If thinner is preferred, spruce up with either cider vinegar, or buttermilk or a splash of pineapple juice!  It&#39;s all good!!",2,2,positive
"These cupcakes were so good! My family loved them. I made them in the morning, and they were a nice snack for breakfast. I would definitely make these a lot!",2,2,positive
I really enjoyed this recipe.,2,2,positive

"I make this 5 batches at a time, or with a family of 6 I wouldn&#39;t get a slice at all! I make them &amp; give them as birthday gifts for all my friends, everyone looks forward to their birthday, since the know they&#39;ll get a loaf!",2,2,positive
This was a great new way for us to enjoy chicken! Moist and lots of flavor! I would definately make this dish again.,1,2,positive
"This is delicious!  Love using the slow cooker in the fall and winter.  Just be careful not to overlook, some of my noodles got a bit crispy around the edges!",2,2,positive
I added 2 small chopped onions and about 3 cups of sharp cheese. Even though my potatoes were very thinly sliced it took about 2 hours to cook. But when I showed up at my neighbor’s cookout everyone loved my dish!,2,2,positive
"What an amazing cake! Usually I  do boxed mixes but this was far superior, and not much work. Very moist, rich and delicious. It was even better the next day! I didn&#39;t do the frosting recipe but used canned vanilla frosting. A thin layer was all you needed because the cake is so rich on its own.",2,2,positive
"made a few changes to this sweet..simple..tasty treat; litely buttered foil, then placed graham crackers to foil. added 3/4 cup of milk chocolate &amp; peanut butter morsels. topped the marshmellows w/ morsels, coconut,  pecans, and crumbled 2 sheet of graham crackers sprinkled over top..baked 15 minutes. WONDERFUL &amp; EASY DESSERT. for the holiday color coconut w/ red or green food coloring!!bbrinson, thomasville, ga",2,2,positive
"My husband ate three bowlfuls &amp; indicated it was okay. I substituted 2 T. potato starch for the flour, used 1 1/2 T. Better Than Boullion Beef Base &amp; shredded cheddar cheese with half and half &amp; milk.",1,1,neutral
I have been making this for years. It is the best! Everyone loves it.,2,2,positive
"Very Good and very creamy!  I added the 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar as was recommended below and it was really good, but be sure to taste and adjust to your tastes.  I will make this again!",2,2,positive
This Cake was Amaazzzing!!..made it for a graduation party as cupcakes with a brown butter cream frosting and people could not stop raving about how good it was!! It&#39;s definitely a must try!!,2,2,positive
This is my new go to recipe. I should have doubled it in a 9x13 pan. Took to a get together and had none left for me. May add cinnamon to cornstarch sauce.,2,2,positive
"This was so easy and good.  I used fresh limes, there were on sale, and definitely more then the recipe called for.  I also used about 1 tsp of chili powder instead of the 1 tbl...my husband ate about 5 of them...and he is a fussy eater!!!",2,2,positive
"Absolutely yummy, this is a keeper.",2,2,positive
I only have ghirardelli (don&#39;t know how to spell it) milk chocolate chips....snow storm so I will be snowed in for a few days....is that ok to use? or will it not taste good? thanks!,0,2,positive
"I&#39;ve been making these for years, since I first saw them in the magazine &amp; they are the best!  A family or office favorite for sure!",2,2,positive
"Delicious, a hit with the entire family!",2,2,positive
Wow! This recipe is excellent! I used gluten-free flour with great results! The peach mixture is so sweet and loved the topping!,2,2,positive
"First time making this. I used a can of cheddar cheese soup and 2% milk and just used a dollop of sour cream in the bowl if anyone wanted it. It didn’t take long to make, was easy and we loved it.",2,2,positive
Added the crumbled bacon and it was yummy.  This soup was a big hit with my crowd.  Will be making this many times over. Thnx.  P.S. Don&#39;t skip the Velveeta,2,2,positive
"Outstanding! One of the best chicken dishes I&#39;ve ever found too. Slight modifications I made include the use of chicken tenders,  and onion powder and garlic powder added to the mushrooms (I didn&#39;t have any green onions). To echo previous comment, this is a new favorite!",2,2,positive
"This recipe is so VERY easy, I have already in less than two weeks made it twice and also gave the recipe to my friends",2,2,positive
Great recipe.  Didn&#39;t change a thing.  Recipe claims it serves 10 but my family of 4 made the whole thing disappear.  Will  make again.,2,2,positive
I made this recipe because of all of the great reviews.  I&#39;m not sure if I would make it again because I felt it was just ok,1,1,neutral
I have been making this ever since it appeared in your magazine years ago. This is one of our most favorite meatball recipe. The only thing I do different is add a little onion powder to the meatballs and I usually add a 8oz. can of tomato sauce because we like extra sauce. We love it withashed potatoes or potatoes I put through my river. DELICIOUS!!! We love the leftovers too :-),2,2,positive
"Since mayo is loaded with soy oil, I use quite a bit less of it than this recipe calls for.  I use about 3/4 cup and mix it with some sour cream.  I also use the spices to taste  -  that&#39;s not nearly enough salt and pepper.  My mom always added a dash of nutmeg to her potato salad and I do too.  It adds just a little different flavor but don&#39;t use too much - just a dash or two (maybe equals about 1/8 tsp or so).  I know a dash is different for everyone!  If I&#39;m feeling lazy or don&#39;t have a lot of time, I sometimes add the pre-cooked bacon bits.  This is very similar to the kind we grew up with.",2,2,positive
"This recipe takes a little time to do, each layer has it&#39;s own &#34;prep work&#34;...BUT.... it is worth the effort! My family LOVED this no-bake, very rich dessert!",2,2,positive
"I have made this cake many times it is a favorite in our family.  But I changed it to use banana pudding mix(sugar-free) and use a small can of crushed pineapple which is sufficient.  Also use 1/2 cup canola oil instead of applesauce.  My great grandson&#39;s special cake, it tastes like a banana flip.",2,2,positive
"I made this recipe for a group of 50 and had many compliments. It&#39;s very easy and if you like a tangy dressing, you&#39;ll like this!!",2,2,positive
This is a nice hearty soup for a cold winter night.  My husband isn&#39;t a huge soup fan and he went for seconds.  I did change it up a bit because I won&#39;t use processed cheese.  I made the rue in a saucepan instead of small skillet and then added the milk to it.  I then added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the milk mixture and whisked it in so there where no lumps.  Then I added that to the beef and potato mixture in the 3qt saucepan.  I mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added 2 tbsp. of Dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel.  I also used reduced sodium broth and didn&#39;t add the added salt at the end of the recipe in order to keep sodium to a minimum.,2,2,positive
Easy recipe to follow; nice textured bread.,2,2,positive
This is a simple easy to make after working all day and was ready in no time!  Very delicious - thanks!,2,0,negative
"The recipe was blend so I ate dried herbs, more salt, onion and garlic powder. After doing that it was amazing",1,2,positive
I made these with turkey &amp; American cheese and fed some hungry athletes while we were on the road.  They were a big hit.  Now I&#39;m making them again for my family.,2,2,positive
Very good recipe,2,2,positive
"Great soup, for some more flavor, use the garlic/herb diced tomatoes.  Adds great flavor to it!",2,2,positive
"Fallowed direction, then added my own twist. Easier to make own taco seasoning, then added pinch of brown sugar and about  teaspoon ancho chili spice. Used ground turkey and &#34;corn&#34; tortillas. Flour tortillas  end up as mosh for left overs. Thanks for other comments, made me realize it&#39;s  a good go to recipe.",2,2,positive
Excellent Pumpkin Bread ?¸¸.•*´¯`? Added raisins only was out of walnuts.,2,2,positive
I think that the coconut qty is 2-1/3 c? I used 14 oz. They are crispy so added 2 more egg whites. Seems recipe is off unless I am only making 1 dip? I made 24 macaroons.,2,0,negative
Really good. I used apple juice instead of orange and cream cheese icing. Worth making again.,2,2,positive
This is my youngest son&#39;s favorite corn bread. It&#39;s so fluffy and light. Honey butter is good on this bread.,2,2,positive
"An easy to fix favorite with great flavor. Usually have all the ingredients in the pantry so it&#39;s a good, quick, and easy workday meal at our house.",2,2,positive
"I am new to this website and WOW! I made this recipe this week and my husband absolutely loved it! Due to what I had in my pantry, I subbed spaghetti sauce and it turned out very yummy. Thank you so much for such an easy and delicious recipe.",2,2,positive
"OMG! Yes  this recipe is delicious, u can tell, look at the reviews.  I made it and the whole pan was gone the same day, between my husband and 14yr old son.  I&#39;m baking another as we speak.  I used 3 VERY RIPE bananas, it is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!",2,2,positive
I am not a bean lover but this was really really good.  I went a little lighter on the refried beans and it was awesome!  And I used salsa instead  of diced tomatoes.  Love it!,2,2,positive
I followed the tips of other reviews and used the entire 3# bag of potato&#39;s and used only 12oz. &#34;Top the Tator&#34; chive flavored sour cream instead of the recommended 24oz. and they turned out great!  Accompanied with BBQ chicken and a spinach tossed salad it was an excellent meal for company and EASY!  Love having something pre-made that can just be popped in the oven when entertaining and this worked perfectly!,0,2,positive
"<p>Moist and very tasty.  It makes a lot of sauce, so I cut the sauce portion of it in half and still had plenty of sauce.</p>",2,2,positive
"After they are cooled and frosted, did you refrigerate them, or only what you have left over?  I&#39;m making them for an event tomorrow and can&#39;t decide whether to frost them and refrigerate, or leave them out on the counter and frost tomorrow?",0,0,negative
It really hit the spot !,2,2,positive
"Quick, easy and flavorful.",2,2,positive
"I decided to make it today after reading the reviews, but it was extremely sweet. I won&#39;t make it again.",1,2,positive
"Fabulous recipe!  Wished I could give it 20 stars!  Who needs packet fajita mix, if you can make this.  This is a keeper in my recipe book.Julie, THANK YOU so much for sharing it with us all.",2,2,positive
"My husband loves these hearty meatballs!  One time, I accidently doubled the Worcestershire sauce and it made them taste even better!",0,2,positive
I made this dish tonight and it was delicious. I only used 2 cups of cheese and also used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of processing tomatoes and paste. Turned out great. I also added my own seasonings on top of what&#39;s called for in the recipe to give it a lil more spice.,2,2,positive
Easy and tasty.  Everyone loved it and will make again.,2,2,positive
"The meat stayed very soft, the oats were completely the WRONG starch to add, and the sauce was sickeningly sweet.  It couldn&#39;t even be salvaged by being made into a sandwich.  I can&#39;t believe so many people liked this.  Gross, just plain gross!",0,0,negative

"I have been making this for years, minus the water chestnuts.  I am often requested to bring my &#34;Funeral Salad&#34; to Church when a luncheon is being served following a Funeral.  It is so well liked.  I&#39;ll try adding the water chestnuts next time.",2,2,positive
Very good.  Could use a little more spice.,2,2,positive
My cake didn&#39;t rise. Isn&#39;t baking soda needed for helping to rise? I didn&#39;t see that in the receipe,1,0,negative
"This is fabulous!!  Trying new recipes is fun, but you never know if the family is going to like them - they loved this!  Even our guest for dinner asked for the recipe!  Will be making this again.  It is so easy and simple to put together.",2,2,positive
I really liked the flavor of this recipe! And the convenience of a slow cooker recipe. I made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts.,2,2,positive
The best soup ever!,2,2,positive

The best soup ever!,2,2,positive
"I remember my mama making this cake. It is basic and tasty, more of a &#34;pound cake&#34; than a fluffy cake and really good for snacking. She would sometimes frost with buttercream and sprinkle heavily with chopped peanuts. Sure does bring back memories.",2,2,positive
A great filling soup that&#39;s perfect on a fall or winter evening. Will definitely make this a regular meal!,2,2,positive
Made a couple adjustments...used basmati rice as don&#39;t have access to rice noodles and I also used pork sausage instead of ground pork.  Used a bag of shredded cabbage rather than shredding it myself.  Did garnish with green onions.  Had a great flavor.,2,2,positive
My whole family enjoyed this recipe they are great with and without the frosting.,2,2,positive
My Mom always made these and we all loved them.  For people complaining about the rice being to hard there is a trick my mom used and I do too.  Put the rice in a bowl and cover with the 1/2 cup water and let it sit for at least 10 mins(I usually get everything else ready and by that time the 10 mins is almost up).  That will soften the rice a little and make it cook better.  We use that trick for making Stuffed Peppers also.,2,2,positive
I cut up the tortillas to layer in pan instead of leaving whole so it is easier to cut or spoon out of dish and I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories,2,2,positive
This is such an amazing recipe! Thank you so much.,2,2,positive
"Super fantastic.   My hubby needed something hearty but liquid and this did the trick.    I did read through the comments and did some changes.   First I started with crimini mushrooms.   When the onions and mushrooms were cooked I added crushed roasted garlic and dried thyme.   I also added a splash (1/4 cup) of sherry to the broth.    Let it boil for about 15min then added whipping cream, some more butter,  another &#34;splash&#34; of sherry and some fresh lemon juice.   Shimmered for about 1/2hr.  Pulled out a 1/2 cup of mushrooms,  then used the immersion blender to what it was in the pot.   Added back the mushrooms set aside.   Did add just a little cornstarch to thicken it a little bit more.   The extra cooking allowed the flavor to developed.  Definitely a keeper recipe.",2,2,positive
"This recipe rocks!!! Easy to make. I double the sauce though, doesn&#39;t seem to be enough.",0,2,positive
I&#39;ve made this recipe more times than I can count....because the chops are ALWAYS tender and the potato/onion combination is addictive!  It never fails to please anyone sitting at my table.,2,2,positive
"I need a lesser quanity,therefore I&#39;ll need to divide the recipe, 3stars.I think I want to try a nippy cheese instead of a Velveeta.",1,1,neutral
I substituted cream of chicken because I bought the wrong thing and skipped the wine. The other ingredients came from a leftover veggie platter and a chicken and rice dinner. It was DELICIOUS.,2,2,positive
"Okay, here&#39;s the thing...I made this and ate a piece right after it had cooled and I thought &#34;what are these people talking about, that this is the best banana bread ever?&#34;  BUT, then I stored it in my fridge and tried a piece the next day and wow, I was hooked and so was my nephew who comes to my house before school (he probably finished off a loaf by himself!)  I do not eat nuts so I left them out and it was so amazing!  Thank you SO much for submitting this recipe!",2,2,positive
"I added some cinnimon, allspice, &amp; nutmeg and increased the bananas to 3. Excellent!",2,2,positive
This cake was delicious. It was so beautiful the frosting was sweet and creamy. It is a great recipe.,2,2,positive
"Very good, but mine came out a little soupier than I expected.  The leftovers thickened up and were perfect! I served it over brown rice.  Next time I will use large or jumbo shrimp, the medium shrived up too much.",2,2,positive
"Oh man, these were SO yummy!  I was surprised that even my picky granddaughter loved them (she ate two and was mad when we wouldn&#39;t let her have another).  I used vanilla rather than almond extract.",2,2,positive

I don&#39;t usually bake but stumbled across this recipe while searching for a pumpkin dessert.  I live at 8K feet so cakes are a real challenge!  This is delicious and easy.  I followed it and added half a walnut to the tops.  It made exactly 24 perfect cupcakes and the frosting was the right amount.  I took them for dessert to a gathering and they were a huge hit!,2,2,positive
Was so flavorful im glad i made it. I served it with garlic bread sticks!,2,2,positive
Yummy quick and easy soup. I added a pkg of gnocchi to mine,2,2,positive
Try it with chili beans and use their sauce.,2,0,negative
Can another rice be substituted for the wild rice?,0,0,negative
This is the absolute VERY VERY BEST of all banana bread recipes. It is to die for!  Super moist and flavorful and quite addicting!  So happy to have found this gem of a recipe!,2,2,positive

I tried this recipe for the first time today. It was the easiest way to make a delicious apple pie. I will never have to buy a apple pie again. I will continue using this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it.,0,2,positive
"My husband loves my meatloaf.  But I&#39;m always on the lookout for new recipes and ways to make it. Mine rarely turns out the same two times in a row. But he always loves it.Seeing that this had 5 stars, I decided to try it.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written. Yes, it was moist, but it was the most bland, tasteless meatloaf I have ever made.  Totally a waste of good ground beef.  Sorry, but I won&#39;t be making this recipe ever again!",0,0,negative
very good cake,0,2,positive
"I made these and they were very good.  I think I am going to make them as part of my holiday gifts.  I did not have a problem with them stitcking to the foil, but they did burn along the edges where the sauce ran off the crackers.  Next time I am going to put enough crackers to fill the entire pan since I could use smaller pieces of crackers along the edges.  I did not cut them either, I just broke them into pieces.  I may add more coconut too.  Thank you for the recipe.",0,2,positive
"I made this meatloaf recipe (times 2) and some mac &#39;n&#39; cheese to send to two different families who are coping with sick loved ones. I was a little nervous because I hadn&#39;t made it before. I cut it into nice slices before packaging it up for sending, which allowed me to taste a slice first. It was delicious! Both families prefer simple, home-cooked foods and this was just the ticket. When I told my sister about the recipe, she reminded me that our Mom used to use crumbled saltines in her meatloaf way back when...! I only made a couple of slight variations to the recipe here. I used 2 lbs of ground round and I added about 1/3 of a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix to the recipe (something my Mom always used in meatloaf. I also only made up a half-quantity of the topping sauce because I didn&#39;t send any with the meatloaf for serving.  I kept a couple slices behind for dinner that night and my husband asked for seconds (there weren&#39;t any!).  He doesn&#39;t even usually like meatloaf!",2,2,positive

"I substituted the cayenne pepper and hot sauce for Tony Cacheries and this was perfect.  Kids loved it, husband loved it!",2,2,positive
I made this soup the other night for supper &amp; it was a big hit!  Quick &amp; easy to make &amp; full of flavor!  Will make it very often.  Didn&#39;t change a thing.,2,2,positive
"Awesome soup...I added about half a bag of baby carrots, a jalapeno pepper, one sweet bell pepper, one onion, 3 stalks of celery, one carton of turkey broth, 5 cups of water, garlic clove, salt &amp; pepper. Cooked until tender, ran veggies thru Vitamix and with the broth mixture I added 3T. of flour and 2cups milk to make my rue. Added the 1 cup of cheddar cheese, stirred and added my pureed veggies. WOW Oh WOW...this soup rocks. Very filling and healthy. According to my calorie count, each cup is about 55 calories...Eat More Soup....  :-)",2,2,positive
"I made this for the second time, this  time I added fresh chopped spinach instead of broccoli. It was just as good.",2,2,positive
This not only taste good . but easy to make and real pretty to serve or give as a gift to someone ..Thanks for the recipe,2,2,positive
Outstanding and simple bread.  The taste is terrific.  I have one package of yeast left during the pandemic so we are eating the bread sparingly.  Nobody has any yeast!  Great bread.,2,2,positive
The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I sauteed some onion with the butter.  My husband loves onion with his mac-n-cheese.  Fabulous recipe!,2,2,positive
I have made this recipe for several holiday meals and also on Sunday meals.  I get many compliments and it is the best lasagna recipe I have ever made.  My husband always orders lasagna when we eat out and he said this recipe tops them all.,2,2,positive
Best cake EVER,2,2,positive
"I made these this morning and they are DELICIOUS! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of just 1 cup white sugar. I added a splash of cinnamon and they are fantastic! I cooked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes, perfect timing. I didn&#39;t fill the  muffin tin half way, so they were a bit smaller than typical muffins but they&#39;re a hit. (Mix the brown sugar with the egg, oil, banana and vanilla extract then add to the dry ingredients!)",0,2,positive
I thought this was very good and tasted much like the more hard to prepare lasagna. I added italian seasoning to the ground turkey and added sliced provolone cheese in between the ravioli layers with italian mix cheese on top. My husband and son were less excited about it than I was but I thought that was because they don&#39;t do the cooking and so they don&#39;t know the time and effort that goes into making &#39;real&#39; lasagna!!,2,2,positive
I have been making this recipe for years and years originally from the Taste of Home Magazine. It is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried and is my staple one. Whenever I bring this in to work everyone swarms around it! Be sure your bananas are very ripe and it will make the bread moist and sweet! I&#39;ve even tried it with some natural sugar substitutes and although the texture is a bit different it still tastes great.,2,2,positive
This breakfast casserole was delicious.  I cooked it in the cast iron skillet I cooked the bacon in.  Then served it with sliced avocado and tomatoes.,2,2,positive
"Very tasty and crunchy. I don&#39;t miss the full fat version of Miracle Whip at all. I used only one onion and that flavor still comes through. I also omitted the water chestnuts for my husband, but it still has a nice crunchy texture.",2,2,positive
This was brought to me as muffins after a motorcycle accident.  THEY ARE THE BEST!!!  I add extra nuts and more bananas but they always turn out great!!,2,2,positive
"An excellent recipe! I used a bit more shrimp, as my family is not fond of scallops. Fish cubes for stock is a good subsitution for both the chicken stock and clam juice. If you do that cut back on the salt. This is a rich and satisfying meal. It looks and tastes sophisticated. Freezes well too.",2,2,positive
This recipe is amazing! Perfect peanut butter cup flavors! A must try!,2,2,positive
"Just made this soup for dinner &amp; absolutely loved it. Forgot to pick up some shredded cheddar cheese, so used velveeta &amp; it was delicious. Will be making it again...soon!",2,2,positive
"I made this recipe as part of our Mother&#39;s Day menu and it was a total hit!  My father is diabetic, so after reading another review I purchased the reduced sugar yellow cake mix by Pillsbury.  I also used a can of light mandarin oranges, used the egg whites from a carton in the egg section rather than cracking eggs and used sugar free Cool Whip.  It was delicious and my dad&#39;s sugar didn&#39;t shoot through the roof - perfect!  The cake tastes MUCH better after being in the fridge for at least 12 hours, and got even better after that.  Wonderful light dessert!",2,2,positive
I used unsweetened almond milk to make it dairy free and Bob&#39;s red mill G.F flour  and it turned out great!I also threw in a couple cups of chopped fresh baby spinach.,2,2,positive
This banana bread is very good and moist. I’ve made it several times with and without the nuts and everytime it’s tasty. The cook time might be a bit long bc mine comes out a little darker than I’d expect but the taste is still really good regardless.,2,2,positive
"This is a great go-to recipe for our family! I&#39;ve also used it to serve supper to our church youth group, and for a meal for families with new babies, etc.I also use the lime juice &amp; chili powder mixture from this recipe to marinate chicken strips. Fast &amp; easy, and they don&#39;t need to marinate for very long to pick up the flavor.",2,2,positive
"Terrific! Used this for a dinner party, and everyone walked away with the recipe. Didn&#39;t change anything about the recipe.",2,2,positive
Very delicious!  Tastes just like my favorite candy bar!,2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made this recipe so many times I&#39;ve lost count. My family loves it..it&#39;s great for family get togethers or when friends come over. The only changes I made were adding the hamburger, leaving out the olives and adding more cheese.",2,2,positive
"I made this soup last night, for the first time!  It was delicious, and it will be one I use again, and again.  I made some slight changes though.  I used fresh rosemary, and thyme instead of basil.   Really tasty.  I also used white cheddar, in place of velveeta cheese. In addition to those changes, I did not have sour cream on hand, so I made a basic rue, as a thickener!",2,2,positive
Our son-in-law loves anything peanut butter...this one is a keeper.  Delicious and easy to put together.  I keep the ingredients on hand for this one!,2,2,positive
Yummy and supper easy to make. Will definitely make this recipe again!,2,2,positive
"I&#39;m generally not a huge ginger cookie fan, but I was looking for something new to bring to a friends house.  These were just amazing!  The ginger flavor is not at all overwhelming, and the texture is exactly what I look for in a cookie.  CHEWY!   This is a keeper.  I froze half the batch and they freeze very well.  Still have the same chewy texture.   I think these would be a good cookie to send to someone if you needed something that would hold up and stay fresh over the delivery time.",2,2,positive
"My whole family and my Girl Scout Troop all love this soup.  You can control how spicy it is and the girls especially love adding cheese, chips, tomatoes, some even like to put lettuce on top.  It&#39;s a staple in my house and on Girl Scout overnights!",2,2,positive
"There is no reason to add flour to potato soup. It will give the soup an artificial starchy taste. Simply use an immersion blender and puree the the soup when the potatoes are cooked. And, use REAL cheese!",1,1,neutral
"This was pretty good! My 1st attempt at making a chicken pot pie and it turned out. It was very easy to make too, so that was nice. I will make a few changes next time and see how it goes. I&#39;ll probably do less Thyme and will try homemade crust but all in all...very good recipe. Will be making again!",2,2,positive
"Tasty, easy to follow recipe! My family definitely approved. Yum delicious ??",2,2,positive

"Absolutely wonderful. I didn&#39;t have dry mustard, so I substituted a gourmet mustard instead.  I kept an eye an it, so that it didn&#39;t come out too dry.  It was in the oven for about 25 minutes.",2,2,positive
"I ended up making this two nights in a row because everyone loved it so much! The first night, I forgot to add the paprika to the marinade so I added to the chicken right before cooking it. I thought it was more flavorful doing it that way. I might try not marinading at all next time.",2,2,positive
"Made this twice in two weeks, once to try and again to serve for company.  I did add half a can of tomato paste to thicken up, but I like my chili thick.  Very tasty!",2,2,positive
One of our al time favorites!  Famile and friends love this!,2,2,positive
Oh Wow! So easy and so tasty! I made my first batch for my husbands work the next day....well it didn&#39;t make it! Gotta make another batch! This is a recipe I am sharing with my daughters!,2,2,positive
"I reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup, reduce the flour to 2 cups, and increase the cornmeal to 1 and 1/3 cup. Tastes great! Next time I might use buttermilk instead of the regular milk.",2,2,positive
At first I wasn&#39;t sure I liked this recipe as it was my first GF banana bread...then after I devoured the half of the loaf I realized I finally found a good sub for my usual recipe.  Added about a 1/2 cup of fresh blueberrys to one of the loaves which turned out great!  My husband couldnt even tell it was gluten free:),2,2,positive
"Worked out perfect as is, I used shredded coconut,  as that is what I had. I did microwave a couple handfuls of chocolate chips checking at 20 sec intrivals and stirring until just melted. Than dipped some of the maccaroons and places them on   parchment. Tried to let them cool, but we ate them before that could happen.   They are delis with or without chocolate.  I would recommend using less sugar if your coconut is sweetened,  or you are using lots of chocolate.",2,2,positive
"Just tried it tonight and loved it!  Like one reviewer said, depending on the salsa you might not even need to add the green chili, unless you like it hot.  I think next time I will half the cream cheese because that made it a little too rich for us.  This would make an easy and popular potluck dish.",2,2,positive
I really liked this recipe. Husband and I have made  this twice and both times cleaned our plates. The lemon flavor is subtle and the shrimp cooked perfectly! A keeper for sure!,2,2,positive
Yum!   My husband doesn&#39;t like whole or creamed corn and it&#39;s hard to find a good corn bread recipe that doesn&#39;t use them.   This is now our go-to corn bread recipe.,2,2,positive
This is absolutely my favorite.  Kids think it&#39;s bland but I love it!!  I did add the hot sauce and put more in than required.  So good.,2,2,positive

I did not add as much broth added some white wine for extra flavor and a can of crushed tomatoes to give it that chili flavor. It was great.,2,2,positive
This is perfect for an office potluck or anytime you need to bring a quick treat to a party (the green grapes are perfect for Christmas)! So delicious and addicting! Note: I left off the brown sugar - was already sweet enough for me.,2,2,positive
"One of my all-time favorites. I use sea scallops, large shrimp and real crab meat. Double the sauce to accompany the larger quantities of seafood used. I also add a good shake of white wine while making the sauce. Learned that one from Gourmet Magazine, many years ago. It is a holiday/special occasion recipe for my company. Always a stellar hit!",2,2,positive

"A crowd pleaser! Moist and delicious. I&#39;m a sucker for Pumpkin SPICE, so I added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp ground clove. Great with or without nuts. But I couldn&#39;t resist folding in 1 cup toasted pecans.",2,2,positive

The second time that I made this cake, I used Swans Down Cake Flour and it made a huge difference in the flavor and the texture!  I also used this recipe to make 36 cupcakes.  I baked them at 325 degrees for exactly 20 minutes and they came out perfect!  This is going to be my &#34;go to&#34; recipe every time I make a cake or cupcakes!",2,2,positive
I made this recipe after having it at work one day and this was better than what I had. It’s very creamy and I didn’t change anything just added more brown sugar and nuts. 10 stars for me,2,2,positive
"Easy recipe, with most ingredients already in the kitchen. Very good. Kids loved it, my toddler included! Suggest pairing it with salad and home made bread sticks for a meal OR a sandwich! Yum! Also, one more suggestion.... the recipe says to put it in a bowl, but I&#39;d put it in a pan and bring it to a boil ;)",2,2,positive
"I made these for breakfast the day after Thanksgiving when we planned to travel early in the morning. Just pop them in the oven for a hot breakfast on the go! My family gave them rave reviews, even with the horseradish sauce! I&#39;ve made them twice since then and used sesame seeds once instead of poppy seeds.  They are lovely and versitile as many substitutions can be made with good results.",2,2,positive
"Very good apple pie recipe! I lost my cookbook that I had for 30 years, which contained my Apple Pie Recipe. I had an idea of all the ingredients I needed but wasn&#39;t quite sure on the measurements. Found your recipe and it was fabulous! I love the use of all 3 spices and the brown sugar.

I used a vegetarian meat substitute (Morningstar Farms Crumbles) instead of ground beef.  I also used 4 cans of vegetable broth instead of the water and bouillon. I did make it with 2 cups of cooked brown rice in the pot the entire time and it was fine. Great recipe! My family loved it!,2,2,positive

I followed the instruction exactly as written and it was honestly the worst dessert Iand#39;ve ever made. I was embarrassed when I sent it with my husband for his cookout and he told me it was awful. I tried it and I threw out the entire thing (6 pieces left). I wish I could give it 0 stars.,0,0,negative
I made this for Easter and it was so good.    Wasn&#39;t able to find sweetened frozen strawberries at my grocery store so I used the unsweetened frozen sliced strawberries.   I made it the day before and followed the directions  and Test Kitchen tips.    The crust was crunchy and the layers were so beautiful!    Will make this again.,2,2,positive
"I had to toss the cake in the garbage. It didn&#39;t bake all the way, I tried to add some time, but that didn&#39;t work either. I have been baked for over 50 years and the only other cake I had to toss was when I was in my teens. I have no idea what I did wrong, the flavor was there but it would not setup. Good luck.",0,2,positive

Fantastic recipe! I had some potatoes I needed to use up so ended up increasing the amounts of everything but salt by half. I also didn&#39;t have shredded cheddar on hand so I used 1/2 Mozzarella and 1/2 American and used whole milk instead of 2%. I can&#39;t wait to make this again.,2,2,positive
"Fantastic recipe. My daughter helped me last night and it was delicious. Easy to make and I&#39;m glad I had her help.  I ended up making a few changes by accident, I could not find a green bell pepper so we used the sweet red and orange pepper.  I did not have chicken thighs on hand so I used chicken breasts - I used 1.5 pounds. I added 2 cups of gluten free penne pasta.  Along with the spices (except red pepper flakes) mentioned to use I also added Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and black  pepper - did not measure just eyed it when added. I also added 1 cup of sodium free chicken broth due to the extra half cup of pasta. Cooked as instructed and the remaining uncovered was cooked for only 15 minutes. I did forget to add the romano cheese, no one really noticed. I will make this again and add into our rotation.  we paired this with a nice spinach salad. Looking forward to left overs.",2,2,positive
Very easy and very delicious!! This is a keeper folks!!  Next time may add some mushrooms and red bell pepper to bulk it up a little...but don&#39;t *have* to.,2,2,positive
"The review process asked if I&#39;d make this recipe again and my answer is yes, yes and yes!  My husband was never one to enjoy  spaghetti with a meat sauce; but when a friend served us this recipe, he changed his mind about spaghetti. It&#39;s been years now since we first enjoyed it and it&#39;s something that everyone I&#39;ve ever served  raves about. I&#39;ve taken it to my church Pot Luck dinners on many occasions; followed by passed out many requested copies of the recipe.

Yummy! A very easy and healthy dish. It was more soupy than I like so I pureed a cup of beans and and added it back to the chili. I also used a roasted garlic broth and additional seasonings to kick it up. I will be making this again very soon!,2,2,positive

I made this recipe when we went to visit our kids and grandkids.  I browned the meat and took along with the other ingredients.  I made this for our supper the night we arrived.  So easy.  Everything was open and add and the taste was incredible.  Would totally prefer this over chili anyday.  Add cornchips and sour cream and cheese.  So good.,2,2,positive

"Loved it! I used 1/2 chunky mango habanero salsa, and 1/2 standard hot, and the texture was great, not runny at all. I usually make my own taco seasoning, and just mixed in some chile powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne, salt/pepper, and fresh garlic. I also added minced serrano pepper. I did make a couple minor substitutions: shallots instead of onion, and monterey jack instead of mexican cheese. The only problem was I ate way too much.  I think next time I&#39;ll try corn tortillas and maybe add a can of corn.",2,2,positive
So good! I used 1 pound each of ground beef and turkey and added some sliced cabbage too. Definitely a keeper!,2,2,positive

"Since I didn&#39;t check my pantry before starting the recipe, I used both Crisco and butter in place of the latter; one packet of Dream Whip in place of the instant vanilla pudding; only one cup of chocolate chips (since that&#39;s all I had); and one cup of toffee bits (to make up for the missing mix-ins). Despite ALL of these changes, the cookies were chewy, moist, and *very* tasty. I&#39;ve added it to my recipe box!",2,2,positive

Has anyone ommited the cottage cheese and used something else? I have one in the family that if they see cottage cheese they won&#39;t use it. Would ricotta cheese work?,2,0,negative
"First pie I&#39;ve ever made.  Turned out perfect.  Tart and juicy, but not to sweet and gooey.  Will definitely be making this again.",2,2,positive
"The broth was excellent, but it seemed more like a cheesy potato soup than cheeseburger. We’ll enjoy this soup anyway, and I’ll make this again, but next time I’ll double the meat and cut back on the potatoes to make it more ’cheeseburgery’",2,2,positive
I love this recipe!!! I have used ground beef or regular Italian sausage.,2,2,positive
A though to try other than apples; pumpkin.  I have used this in recipe to bring down the fat and add nutrients that are good for you.  After reading this recipe I think it would be good with pumpkin.,0,2,positive

Everyone loved this!  I will definitely be making this again.,2,2,positive
"For anyone who thinks this recipe looks good don&#39;t be deceived. For me, it looks like vomit and it tastes the same even substituting REAL cheese for that Velveeta plastic cheese. I&#39;m sorry if I sound like a snob but Velveeta is for those who have no idea what real cheese.",0,1,neutral

Tried this for the 1st time and will have to make it again to keep everybody happy.  Everyone really enjoyed it.,2,2,positive
"Mine was a total disaster, raw in the middle and so dense. I cut the crust thinly off and they were yum. I think the recipe  is confusing  as i read it 2 1/4 cups of water and   3 cups flour  then it asked me to add . Mix till smooth well it was dough at that point  couldnt add in any more flour",0,0,negative
"My husband is not a pancake lover, but it has now changed after I tried this recipe.  I make a batch of these every weekend, and he eats them through the week for breakfast.  I love the fact they have oatmeal.  I add blueberries for him.  Dee-licious!",2,2,positive
"I have been looking for a good tasting &amp; easy restaurant quality tortellini soup-this recipe is a keeper.  I doubled it, used frozen tortellini &amp; frozen spinach.  I also used hot turkey sausage and homemade chicken stock.  Very filling, but also light, tasty, no added salt and good for you.  I love the ease that this comes together-one pot, chop an onion &amp; garlic and toss everything else in.  It was finished so quickly too..a little parmesan adds salt and creaminess that makes it just perfect.  Yummo.",2,2,positive
"I have been making this one for years and it is one of my favorites.  Nice, light version.  Just the right amount of butter/oil.  Now if I can only get the price of shrimp down...",2,2,positive

Made for Christmas and they were a hit. I used less salt because of high blood pressure but they still were great.,2,2,positive
I made these twice over the past year and just love them.  So easy to prep ahead.  I don&#39;t seem to use a full 1/2 cup of horseradish sauce but they still have a kick.,2,2,positive
This was really good.,2,2,positive
"Very easy, moist and delicious! A keeper for sure!",2,2,positive
"I didn&#39;t have capers, so I just left them out. My husand and I loved this. The fish was tender, and the flavor was just enough without being overpowering. Great with aparagus.",2,2,positive
"This is possible the best apple pie anyone I have ever served it to has eve had after making a few changes.  For deep dish, I doubled the oats, used 1/1 4 cups butter and used alittle more flour for the crust and topping.  I also omitted the water cornstrach method althogether, but added alittle lemon juice to the apples instead. I mixed same amount of tapioca, as cornstarch, into apples(which can be increased along with sugar depending on pan side) along with the sugar and put the vanilla in apples too; decreased the oven temp to 325-335 and baked until apples were done.  I also covered the edges with tin foil from the start. Never stayed on the counter very long. Yum Yum",2,0,negative

"I made this as our after-church meal for Christmas Eve.  Everyone really liked it!  It was great to be able to put it all together earlier in the day, and then just add the shrimp and make the rice when I got home.  I\&#39;ll definitely make this again.",2,2,positive
Made this for a cookout.  My husband asked for it twice within the week after the cookout.  Great old tyme flavor.  Also makes a great dip for veggies and crackers.  I didn&#39;t have celery salt so I very finely minced a celery stalk and that was great.  A little extra crunch with a lot extra flavor!,2,2,positive
"Excellent dish. I froze it to make sure it didn&#39;t get soggy. Also used half the sugar.  Was still plenty sweet. Will surely make again, perhaps with chunky peanut butter.",2,2,positive
great bars.  I also use sliced canned or fresh peaches and sprinkle chopped nuts on top.  I don&#39;t frost mine.,2,2,positive
"Excellent! Was looking for another low carb dish when I found this. I sauteed some chopped mushrooms and added them to the sauce, omitted the pepper cause we don&#39;t like it. I used marinara sauce that was low in sugar in place of the tomato sauce. This is very tasty! My hubby suggested next time to use Italian sausage instead of ground beef but I thought it was perfect.",2,2,positive
"I was really impressed with this. I had just over 1.5 lbs of chicken breasts, and after pretty much exactly 5 hours exactly it shredded incredibly easily. The flavor was really good too. I&#39;ve never been one to put salsa on my tacos or burritos (I&#39;m more of a pico de gallo person), this was super good. It also made enough that I&#39;m going to definitely get more than a few meals out of it. Easy, quick and cheap.By the way, I bought a can of corn, accidentally got creamed corn, and (while this was the first time I made this, so I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s supposed be exactly), I don&#39;t think it changed anything. The salsa has enough liquid that it got absorbed without an issue.I&#39;m definitely making this again.",2,2,positive
this is a large and tasty pie. I added a little cinnamon and will try other fruits and berries when I make it again.,2,2,positive
This is a delicious recipe;and I have made it many times;very light; one of my husbands favorite.,2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made these many times now - they are hearty and tasty! I&#39;ve begun adding a chopped apple and a handful of chopped walnuts to the batter - takes it up another notch.  Because this batter is so thick, I cook them at a slightly lower temp on the griddle - otherwise they tend to get overly brown on the outside before the inside is done.  I use buttermilk powder - stirring the powder in with the dry ingredients and using 1 cup of water with the other wet ingredients (egg and oil). As long as I have all of the ingredients on the counter, I make up several batches of the dry ingredients in zipper bags and store them in the refrigerator.  Makes a really quick and easy meal any time of the day!!",2,2,positive
I just cooked this recipe to a tee for my Cuban family and everybody loved it. I doubled the portions of everything to make more for a big group of people and made a cilantro salsa to top it off with that just put the final touch on this restaurant quality recipe! The only thing different was I let the chicken marinate overnight which was a good choice because the flavors infused into the chicken and I splashed lemon juice all over the final product to get it extra zest plus it just looks cool and like I know what I&#39;m doing. I don&#39;t. I&#39;m just good at following directions :) Absolutely delicious! This is now my go to fajita recipe!!,2,2,positive
delicious and easy,2,2,positive
This cake was fabulous. I had a difficult time eating too much of it knowing how much butter was in the frosting (4 sticks!) I think next time I will use my own chocolate buttercream frosting recipe that calls for 1/3 cup of butter instead. The texture of the cake itself was superb. The ganache and the chocolate garnish on top were very easy to make. I loved the overall taste and appearance of the cake and will definitely make it again (but with a less buttery frosting!),2,2,positive
"Excellent bread, convection baked at 350 in a Pyrex pan and metal pan, the Pyrex took 5 minutes more (50 minutes). Used an add&#39;l 1/2c of Maple Grove Farms pancake mix and 4t xanthan gum. With 3/4c sugar and medium ripe bananas it&#39;s not overly sweet. I&#39;ll add chocolate chips next time.",2,2,positive
"I have had this with Splenda and it&#39;s just as good, also have used almond instead of vanilla for a stronger flavor.",2,2,positive
"<p>Honestly haven&#39;t made this yet, but it looks scrumptious! Question, though - approx. how thin should &#34;thinly sliced potatoes&#34; be?  ¼-inch, ⅛-inch...? I want these to come out as yummy as they look/sound!</p><p>Thanks!</p>",2,2,positive
"This was so simple to make, very moist and tasty, and much more volume than a regular cake.  Good pot luck dessert.",2,2,positive
This is the first apple pie I&#39;ve ever mad and is seriously one of THE BEST apple pies I&#39;ve ever tasted!!! I followed the heaping tablespoon suggestion for the flour but all the other directions as is. I believe I&#39;ve made another dish better than my mother-in-law and she&#39;s been making her pie for well over 50 years. My husband was pleasantly surprised!,2,2,positive

"I like this recipe, easy to make and tasty.  I made a few changes: used Pamala&#39;s gluten Free baking flour; instead of sugar I used ½ cup monk fruit sweetener; and cut the butter to ½ cup.  It baked up really nice.  I think I will put some corn kernels in next time.",2,2,positive
I used Mrs. Richardson&#39;s butterscotch caramel topping (full-fat) and it was fabulous.  It was a definite favorite over the pumpkin and sweet potato pies.  I also used low-fat cream cheese which worked very well.  Happy Thanksgiving!,2,2,positive
this recipe is a classic. i make it often. Add fresh carrots and celery to stock or celery seed of you don&#39;t have celery and it gives it great flavor,2,2,positive

"<p>My husband and I really enjoyed this baked spaghetti.  My only change I made was to leave out the olives because we aren&#39;t fans of them.  Next time, to appeal more to the kids I will likely used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because they turned their noses up at the &#34;tomato chunks&#34;, and be sure to dice up the peppers smaller than I did.</p>",2,2,positive
"This recipe does call for &#34;2 cups COOKED long grain rice&#34;, so I don&#39;t know why it would turn out gummy. You are supposed to cook the rice before you add it to the soup. This is absolutely a wonderful soup. Even my husband who doesn&#39;t like stuffed peppers, or green peppers at all for that matter, loves this soup. I add a small chopped onion, and saute the onion and green pepper when I brown the ground beef. Drain. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Delish!",2,2,positive
Loved it. I will definitely try some of the suggestions in the below comments for doubling the sauce and adding a little garlic or lemon juice.,2,2,positive

"I love this recipe. I made my own graham cracker crust--better than store bought &amp; easy to throw together. You can definitely pick out the gelatin flavor you like and match a yogurt to it for peach, strawberry, or any flavor you like! Most of the ingredients I had on hand.",2,2,positive
This is now my go to recipe for banana bread!  We made a loaf with chocolate chips and a loaf with walnuts.  Excellent!!!,2,2,positive
Added cinnamon &amp; nutmeg like others.  A little water because batter was so thick too.  But it is nice to eat a substantial pancake and not one that is tasteless.  Have made it twice.  So hearty and good!,2,2,positive
We like this chicken the way the original recipe states and we tried it with a 20 oz can of pineapple rings. The juice added a wonderful new dimension to the flavor of the chicken and the pineapple rings were added to the chicken and everything grilled together.

"FANTASTIC!! Ever since I discovered this recipe in my Taste of Home magazine, I&#39;ve made it at least once a month. I serve it over copycat Chipotle cilantro lime rice. I double the marinade, and don&#39;t throw it away so there&#39;s a bit of sauce for the rice. Seriously one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten!! Everyone I&#39;ve served it to loves it!!

Made this for company breakfast and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Making it today again...  So easy and I think I cut back slightly on fat and it was still good... A definite keeper!,2,2,positive
OMG!!! This cake is awesome!  Key to getting the frosting right is to make sure the whipping is really cold. Recommend putting in the freezer for about 15 mins before you use it.  I will totally make this again!  Enjoy!,2,2,positive
This is absolutely the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had. It is totally worth the effort. Thank you so much for sharing!,2,2,positive
"Edit:  made with miracle whip light.   Was much better.  Especially the next day.This looks and sounds unappetizing, but intrigued by the numerous 5 star reviews, I went ahead and made it.  I only had low fat mayo (no miracle whip), so I used that.  I only put one onion in because it looked like a lot, but might add half or all of the second one.I was expecting it to taste like coleslaw AND macaroni salad. I think it pretty much tastes like coleslaw with a bit of pasta added.   It makes a ton.",2,2,positive
This is pretty much how I make my apple pie but I like the idea of using brown sugar. Also it&#39;s a LOT easier to use a potato peeler to peel the apples. Nice recipe!,0,2,positive
Made this and used Egg Replacer as we have egg allergies. It was AWESOME! Fabulous recipe! Used King Arthur Gluten Free flour and Bob&#39;s Red Mill egg replacer. I halved the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still plenty sweet. I may cut it down to 1/4 next time and see how sweet it is.,2,2,positive

Perfect little sliders for any event. Not a fan of the Hawaiian sweet rolls so I used Rhodes frozen small dinner rolls. For us they were perfect. I also cut back on the brown sugar. I also had no Horseradish sauce so used mayonnaise on both the top and bottom of the rolls. I also did not leave them over night in the fridge. Made up early in the morning  worked out just fine.  This is a wonderful recipe. One that I will frequently make.JanieTaste Of Home Volunteer Field Editor,2,2,positive

It&#39;s not often that I will find a recipe that is good for me to keep. This one is a keeper.",2,2,positive

"I&#39;m rating 5 stars because it&#39;s really delish, but I would not take mine anywhere because of how it looked.  The layers rose in the oven but sunk in the middle as they cooled.  And, no, nothing happened to make them fall.  What could I have done wrong?I think I packed the brown sugar too firmly because it took forever to cream with the amount of butter and to me, never got the fluffy texture.  So, would overbeating have done it?Thanks for your input.Thanks",2,2,positive
"This recipe rivals any Chinese restaurant.  Made with boneless chicken thighs and served on a bed of rice and oriental steamed veggies.  Amazing.  Definitely double the sauce, it is that good.  No need to thicken.",2,2,positive
"This is literally the best soup recipe I&#39;ve ever made.  I keep making it, freezing it, remaking it... I&#39;m a big fan of onions so I choose to caramelize some onions in the main pan to add a little more of a flavor layer, but it&#39;s great with or without it.   MAKE THIS SOUP!",2,2,positive
This recipe was great but spicey. I will make this a lot but without the red pepper flakes. Even my kids loved this!,2,2,positive
"My family devoured this chicken.  The sauce is excellent and goes great over rice.  I could not find boneless skinless chicken thighs at the grocery store so I used bone-in chicken thighs that I took the skin off of.  I tried boneless skinless chicken breasts once but have to say the bone-in thighs gave it more flavor.  However, both are good.",2,2,positive
"This was perfectly simple and delicious! I made it just as written. I started with 5 cups of flour, but easily made it to 6.5 cups while kneading the dough. I only have one bread pan, so I put half of the dough in a loaf pan and made the rest as a round loaf in a casserole dish. Both turned out great.

"This was the best pot pie that I have ever eaten.  I halved the recipe so that I  made one pie just for my husband and  me. It is one that I will make again and will share with others how good it was.  I moved it to a lower rack the last 5 minutes to make sure the bottom crust was well done. Again one of the best ever!      ( chopped half a large onion. I peeled/diced and boiled  2 potatoes, used 2/3 cup frozen corn and 1/2 cup peas and  3/4 cup canned carrots, drained  the ones that needed to have liquid removed , boiled 2 ck breast and shredded them )  the sauce was half of the regular as given  and had great flavor and thickened  well. Had a little extra filling left over so I made  a very small one with just crust on top.       Yummy.                              ***I see that another reviewer said they made the full recipe and froze half  of the filling for another time, good idea also.",2,2,positive

"Absolutely delicious. Time was limited, so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for 1-4 hours, as directed by the recipe. We still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful! So much so, that when making it again, we will not marinate the chicken, as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less time/planning ahead.  Otherwise, there is not a thing I would suggest differently. I just wanted to point this out because often times the &#34;set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours&#34; deters one from choosing a particular recipe. So, I want to make it known that if you&#39;re looking for THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS but in a pinch for time, that is not a reason to pass this one up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This was printed off and put into our family cook book, as we will be making this often. Thank you for sharing! ?",2,2,positive
This did not take as long to make as I thought it would.  I did do a few short cuts though.  I didn&#39;t blend the tomatoes and it turned out just fine.  I only simmered the chicken mixture 10 minutes and only left the dish in the oven for 10 minutes after uncovering.  It still was delicious.  Ground beef or sausage could easily replace the chicken.  I&#39;m not a big fan of chicken in red sauces but most dishes of this kind use beef or sausage so the chicken was a nice change of pace.  The chicken could even be shredded or cut very small so it&#39;s not as noticeable.  This could easily be prepared ahead of time for a busy next day.  Prepare the chicken mixture and refrigerate since it&#39;s the step that takes the longest or prepare the entire dish and bake it the next day.  We are a family of 5 and so there is only a few small servings left over.  Next time I may double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8.,2,2,positive
"<span>lillith129Can anyone tell me how to make the decorative curly chocolate?</span> <span>Those are super easy!  Take some chocolate candy making wafers and place them in a zip lock bag, place the bag in a cup of water for a minute or so - just long enough to melt the chocolate.  Snip a tiny corner off the bottom of the bag and make some decorative swirls on a wax paper covered baking sheet.  Pop the sheet in the freezer for a few minutes and they&#39;ll set right up nicely.  You can peel them off and place them where ever you want them!</span>  <span>I&#39;ve done letters and put them on dishes of pudding topped with whipped cream for a fancy (and EASY) treat!</span>  <span>Give it a try!</span>",0,2,positive

wow!! amazing banana flavor ...very soft n moist...cant resist eating another piece :) this bread is awsome...definately a keeper ! used 3 bananas as suggested by other reviewers...thanks to all :) 3 do make a big diff. in taste...used a cup of brown sugar...n added a few blueberries just at top which made the bread look really pretty!! didnt sink in the batter even... baked in a foil loaf pan n a small pyrex dish......used baking powder as i only had it at hand....baking time was exact as recipe states....no added nuts cuz my kids r not a huge fan of nuts....will definately be making it again....though will use 1/3cup of oil next time just to chk if it still stays moist enough...its outside was crusty...n i liked it ! my neighbour did it too....her remarks were &#34;excellent&#34; thanks to TOH :) thumbs up!,2,2,positive
I’ve tried many white bread recipes and this is the only one I make now. I make this weekly and it’s got a lovely texture. Toasts up amazing! Nice and easy and I make croutons out of the end piece. Keeps brilliantly in the fridge and perfect for sandwiches.,2,2,positive
"Easy, light, delicious!  I did use cole slaw mix and it worked great !",2,2,positive
A total hit with my family! I adapted it for fewer servings using an 8 x 8 pan and omitted all the almond extract because I&#39;m not a fan. I added sliced almonds on top of the pie filling instead. Mine took the full bake time. Definitely making this again.,2,2,positive
I make this cake all the time but I use a pineapple cake mix.  More pineapple flavor that way.,2,2,positive

"Good, basic white bread. I bake a lot of fancy breads and thought I would give this a go and it came out fine. I also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves. It had a nice crust and the bread itself had a nice &#39;sopping up&#39; power with my tomato based sauce. It was a little heavier than store bought, mass produced, &#39;half-baked&#39; store bought garbage, but that is obviously to be expected. We went through both in less than 2 days. I&#39;d make it again.   For those having issues, following directions is key. Use bread flour. Be patient. Put away your bread machine. Temp your water. Let the starter work. Don&#39;t use too much flour....only what it needs. (You probably won&#39;t need all 6 cups) If this isn&#39;t taking you a good 3-4 hours to make, you&#39;re doing it wrong.",2,2,positive

This is my go to breakfast casserole. I like to add cooked asparagus and extra cheese. Definitely worth the calories. Easy to make the night before and bake in the morning.,2,2,positive
"I love this recipe and so does everyone that has ever had it!  I originally got this from a friend at work whose mother subscribed to TOH.  I have made this many times over the years, I use American cheese (cheese slices) , I didn&#39;t care for the velveeta in it,  So glad the recipes are all on here, makes it so much easier than searching though old magazines!",2,2,positive

"I tried this recipe for the first time tonight &amp; am thrilled with how well it came out. The flavour is great &amp;, thanks to my salsa, has the perfect amount of spice.

I&#39;m definitely in the minority on with this rating  but I used 8 inch cake pans and had about a cup of overflow onto the bottom of my oven.  The rim  of the pan was  also covered with batter which made removal from the pan difficult.   Followed the instructions exactly and didn&#39;t change a thing.  Think I&#39;ll cut back on the amount of strawberries in the frosting to avoid  a runny frosting.    It&#39;s for my grand daughter&#39;s birthday and I&#39;m hoping the frosting covers up the messy cake.,1,1,neutral
"At last a moist, delicious GLUTEN FREE banana bread recipe!!   I used one cup Gf all purpose flour and one cup brown rice flour bc that&#39;s what I had on hand.

"A really, really good recipe. I don’t usually tried recipes that are labeled “best ever”, but I had the ingredients for this one. The bread is moist, is has the right texture and strong banana flavor. A definnite winner. I used a scant cup on the oil simply because I ran out and it was still very moist.",2,2,positive
Excellent! I like to use kale instead of spinach sometimes.,2,2,positive
Got this recipe from my sister last year and I have made it many many times and even put some in the freezer. It is sooooo good and everyone I have ever fixed it for wants the recipe. I have even made it for a friend that has to count sodium intake. I used no salt broth and seasoned myself. Best chicken chili recipe ever!!!!,2,2,positive

Love this recipe.  I have made it three times and my family have commented how good it tastes. It is nice to use whatever you have on hand.  One family member can&#39;t have corn so I just added mushrooms and celery.  Love you can freeze one for later.  It is in my recipe box as a keeper.,2,2,positive

I didn&#39;t change anything in the recipe, however, I did make it the day before, covered it and put it in the refrigerator. I took it out 30 minutes before I baked it. It is a keeper and the only breakfast Casserole I will make from now on.",2,2,positive
"A favorite here.  I usually make it w/ low-fat beef, but didn&#39;t have it on hand when I made it today.  It was a little soggy w/ the 80/20 beef, but the kids still tore it up!",2,2,positive

"I am a New Englander. We&#39;ve been making cornbread, corn cakes, Johnny cakes, and Indian pudding using corn since the time of the Pilgrims. No way is corn bread a one region baked good. Just like chili, barbecue sauce and pizza vary from state to state, region to region, so does cornbread. There&#39;s no right or wrong way to make it. It&#39;s what you grew up with, what your grandma made and what you came to love. Nowhere does this recipe claim to be &#34;southern&#34; cornbread. Or &#34;northern&#34; cornbread. Make your cornbread however you like, just don&#39;t tell me my way is wrong.",0,0,negative
Just made these for Harvest Day at work. They are very tasty!,2,2,positive
"Firstly, I never peel or seed my zucchini.  My mom&#39;s recipe for the cupcakes are similar so i just used hers.  I made the frosting and it was more like a glaze..should i cool it completely before adding conf. sugar?  Instead of putting it in when it&#39;s lukewarm?  It definately did not look like the picture.  I then added a pack of cream cheese and more conf. sugar and it turned out fabulous!!",2,0,negative

"My husband and I both loved this recipe. Easy to put together, turned out perfectly, we&#39;ll use it again and again. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, to make up for the person earlier this month who gave it only 1, without making it and in spite of saying it sounded delicious, due to not being able to eat cheese and apparently not understanding what &#34;gratin&#34; means...",2,2,positive
"I was a little apprehensive about this one, but boy was it tasty.  I think this will be one of my favorites this fall.  Absolutely delicious.",2,2,positive
Very good! I didn&#39;t have any of the spices but had a pack of white chicken chili seasoning and used it.  I also left out the green chilies since I have young children.  Because we have 6 people in our family I added 2 more cans of beans and more broth to stretch it further.  Still very good.  Gonna add this to  my regular winter recipes,2,2,positive

"I loved the way this recipe came out. My friend sent it me because she wanted to try a GF recipe, so I figured I&#39;d check it out as well. I substituted Olive Oil for Canola Oil because I didn&#39;t have Canola Oil. Also, I used a half cup of sugar, and added chocolate chips. For this recipe, I made muffins instead of a loaf, and for that I baked the muffins for 30 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time for them. The end result was very moist, and delicious muffins. It made 12 muffins (I filled the cups almost to the top, so they were quite full).. I usually cut the sugar on recipes, especially when they call for one cup (it just seems excessive). I considered using honey as a substitute for the sugar, and may try the recipe again doing just that. I think what helps this recipe stay so moist is adding the apple sauce.TL:DR - Recipe was delicious!",2,2,positive
"My family loves this cake. I have made it for birthdays and as a grooms cake. I wish I would have thought to dip the strawberries first, because that was my only complaint-that the berries release their juices when they touch the frosting. I will continue to make this cake...fantastic",2,2,positive

"This is really a great recipe. I know that all our ovens bake differently, but if you check your bread at the one hour mark, then 5 minute intervals after that, this bread won&#39;t over cook. At one hour it&#39;s still really wet inside, but it firms up really fast after that. Mine was done at 1 hour 10 minutes and was perfect. I hope that helps",2,2,positive

I&#39;ve made this cake for a baby shower, and my church, everyone who tries it loves it.",2,2,positive
"I have made this wonderful recipe since TofH published it in the magazine.  I use Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting, though.  If you get a few leftovers since it makes a big batch, try wrapping cut pieces in plastic wrap and putting them in the freezer to put in lunch bags.  They are outstanding.",2,2,positive

"This was my 1st time making a gluten free banana bread. I am new to gluten free lifestyle per Dr. orders, I am also trying to get my family into the lifestyle so we can enjoy food together as I always feel left out. I made this recipe without the applesauce.Per the advice of other reviews I also added a 1/2 cup more flour but I used Bob&#39;s Red Mills Pancake mix. I only used 3 eggs and 3/4 sugar. My family loved it, they had no idea it was gluten free! I added enjoy life mini chocolate chips to one loaf and they loved it! Next time I think I will add more vanilla n cinnamon!

"Awesome!  I loved the taste and texture of the cake.  The icing was very sweet, but still delicious!  I had a lot of icing leftover, so I would halve the recipe for the icing next time.  This is definitely a winner!",2,2,positive
This is a great flavor combination! I loved it! My only suggestion is to cook the bacon at the same time as the chicken in another skillet. At the end I placed the chicken in the skillet I had cooked the onions in and layered the chicken in there and allowed the cheese to melt. Delicious!,2,2,positive
"I wish I could save these changes without a review because I really dislike when people change a recipe and still review it. Since TOH doesn&#39;t have the option to make notes, here goes. I made this heart healthy by deleting the bacon and sautéing the onion and carrot in olive oil. After that, I added chicken that I had baked separately and used 2% milk and 2% reduced fat cheese. I followed all of the other directions. My family loved it.",2,2,positive
"The first time I made this, I didn&#39;t let the chicken sit in the marinade for 8 hrs, it was more like a couple of hours. I also forgot to set aside marinade to baste with when grilling. Despite my faults, the taste was still amazing, and it has been requested over and over again. Great flavor, and so easy!!!",2,2,positive
"I liked this recipe and would have given it a 5-star rating, but the meat sauce was too dry. I added a cup of beef broth during the last half hour and it was fine.",2,2,positive

"Very easy and tasty cake.  Served for a family picnic, and it was the first desert that was gone! Will make again.  NOTE: it was very hot at our picnic, and the buttercream frosting didn&#39;t hold up well, and rolled down the cake.   Next time I serve for a summer picnic, I will adjust the frosting... however the frosting tasted wonderful.",2,2,positive

"I made this. It was pretty good. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was still way too sweet. I’ll omit the sugar next time. I’d consider this a dessert rather than a side dish but it’s good. Note if you make this with cheese, it will be slightly less firmer than without so you may want to lessen a liquid ingredient maybe the milk.",2,2,positive
"This is a HIT.   I double for a 9x13 pan, and used whipped real whipping cream with no sugar instead of coolwhip.",0,0,negative

I have been making this soup since I first saw the it in your magazine.  This is one of our family&#39;s favorites.  I do add extra ground beef and double the recipe now as my family has grown over the years.  I like to serve it with homemade bread bowls.  I am making it again today. Thanks for the recipe.,2,2,positive
These are great. The only change I made was to add a can of black beans.,2,2,positive
I have made this bread a couple times and love it.. I only had rapid rise yeast.. So i only had to let it rise once.. I just put all the ingredients in a stand up mixer bowl together and mix and then add my bread attachment and finish adding the flower.. After you mix it and if you use Rapid yeast let it rest for 10 minutes then cut in half put in the pan and let rise and turn the oven on and bake them.. Best bread recipe ever..,2,2,positive
"Very tasty, but the bottom tortilla was very hard.  I let it sit for 10 minutes before we cut it and it still oozed all over the place.  Did not turn out well....maybe my salsa was too watery, I&#39;m not sure, but we couldn&#39;t even save it for leftovers; it was too runny.",1,1,neutral

I used ground turkey and chicken bullion but it wasn&#39;t that. here is what I did: browned the turkey and onions, threw in the potatoes and carrots with the water and buillion and simmer about 15 minutes. While that was nhappening I made a roux out of butter (I used 4 T instead of the 2) and flour, milk, melted in the cheese. By the time the vegs were soft the cheese mixture was ready and I just threw it in the pot. Soup done. Tasted great and no worry with lumps. Really good with ground turkey by the way.",2,2,positive

Sooo good!  I used more cheese and onion and meat.  Everyone loved it!,2,2,positive
Absolutely delicious and definitely nostalgic. I made this last night and it came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly without any issues.  I used two round Nonstick pans. It&#39;s a pretty cake as well as tasty! It&#39;s a recipe my mother (R.I P. 9-2018) made and was requested often at family gatherings. I thought of her with many fond memories while making it. Looks like I&#39;ll be carrying on the tradition now.,2,2,positive

After arguing who was going to get the last two, we cut them in half and @ got an extra half more!  The fresh tomatoes, basil and crunchy parmesan were excellent.  I know my sons could make this recipe all by themselves, and they probably will!  Can&#39;t wait for the weather to change so I can start growing basil &amp; tomatoes.  YUMMO",2,2,positive

I think I will put it into two 8&#34; dishes and pop one in the freezer for later.  Great recipe!,2,2,positive
"You should use milk, not egg white to brush on the pie crust. Pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end, if they’re browning too quickly. Time given is not long enough to cook the filling. It needs twice as long as stated here. It also needs a higher starting temperature. It should be baked at 425 degrees for the first 20 minutes then turned down to 375 degrees to bake for a further 40 minutes or so. Also, I used Bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so I’d increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy.",1,0,negative
"This pie was delicious! It was the first homemade pie I ever made, but the recipe was easy, it included items I usually already have in the kitchen, and it didn&#39;t take much time to prep. However, I only had Gala apples which made the pie perfectly sweet, but not too sweet. I didn&#39;t have any ginger so I missed out on that intended kick the recipe included. The top layer of my crust was still raw after 25 mins, so I added 13 more minutes...it was then half- undercooked, so I added 10 more minutes and adjusted to 400 degrees. Maybe I had the pie on a rack too low in the oven. All I know that in the end, it was delicious!",2,2,positive
Need to leave the jalapeno out when the kids are here. Otherwise it was great!,2,2,positive

This was absolutely delectable!!! I made this for a group of my friends and they devoured it!!! I used just a normal loaf of white bread and that worked just fine. And the sauce is the cherry on top!! Be prepared for it to take a little bit longer to bake then the recipe states...it almost took me an hour and 15 for it to start to brown.,2,2,positive
"This is a humble cake. And, it is delicious. I have made it numerous times and it comes out perfectly every time. I don&#39;t understand how it doesn&#39;t come out for others. I make a could of small tweaks. I use unsalted butter for all of my baking, so I added a teaspoon of salt and whisked it together with the flour, baking power and salt before adding them to the batter. I used twice the vanilla. Also, I think it makes a big difference if you add ingredients very gradually. Make sure an addition of flour is almost completely incorporated before adding the next.",2,2,positive
This was delicious!  My family raved about it for days!,2,2,positive

I followed the recipe exactly, baked it the night before, and refrigerated it overnight. It came out just like the picture. I am a high school teacher and every year our guidance department has an evening event to help encourage students to pursue post-secondary educational opportunities. We all bake pies for the students and parents to enjoy. I always have difficult time deciding what to make, but this year it will be easy. This pie is great and I am sure it will be a hit.",2,2,positive

Super quick and easy and my family LOVES this recipe! I use ground turkey in stead of beef.  The only other change I made was stirring the sour cream into the sauce mix after removing from heat.  This recipe is a real keeper!,2,2,positive
Very good.  I increased the receipe ingredients to make it deep disn.  Of course I increased the cooking time.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon to the syrup mix for a more thanksgiving/fall flavor.,2,2,positive

Made this for Christmas dinner...don&#39;t let it fool you that it takes 35 minutes to assemble. This by far is the best seafood lasagna recipe.

This clam chowder was good but not great .  I didn&#39;t find the finished product to be worth the amount of work that went into it. It looked simple and it was but there was a fair amount of chopping.  I served it with good bread and salad and we found that to be quite filling.  I had some left and froze it.  We&#39;ll see if it tastes better when I reheat it. I&#39;m not sure I would make this again.,2,1,neutral
"This was wonderful!  My husband and I are both on keto, and this tasted so good!  It makes for good leftovers as well.

I will definitely be making this again when we have a bunch of zucchini fresh from our garden!",2,2,positive

The dough is way too soft and just runs into a big mass of a dough sheet!  I reviewed the recipe because I thought I had made an error but no. Sorry  but there are much better recipes out there for soft molassses and ginger cookies!",1,1,neutral
My husband and I and our two guests absolutely loved this dessert! The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of confectioner&#39;s sugar to the cream cheese and omit it from the pudding mix as per another&#39;s review. It was perfect! Will make often.,2,2,positive
"Oh my Goodness!  This dish is absolutely FANTABULOUS!!!!!  I used 1.5 pounds of shrimp (12 ounces), 1 pound (16 ounce) of REAL jumbo lump crab meat, and 1.5 pounds of bay scallops (12 ounces).  I doubled everything else.  I also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and I added the garlic just before I added the broth and juices.  I used Costco&#39;s fresh, aged parmigiano reggiano cheese.  My sauce was not bland at all!  It was thick, rich and decadent!  Also, in the doubling process, I used an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and an 8 ounce bottle of lobster juice.  Be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isn&#39;t runny.  Additionally, because mine did not brown after 38 minutes of baking, I put it under the broiler for about 2 minutes.  It was perfect!  While the seafood makes the dish costly, it was well worth it!  I will certainly be making it again!",2,2,positive
I love meatloaf but wanted to try a different recipe my husband and I love cheese so I decided to give this one a try. It is delicious but do agree there is a bit much brown sugar in it but that can be fixed. Thank you for the idea and love that they are mini so you can pack them in your lunch box for work and have a little hunk of meat to munch on. Will definitely be making this for years to come.,2,2,positive

"Absolutely FANTASTIC!  This recipe is so versatile that can be altered with different ingredients according to ones liking.  I made it for dinner last night &amp; my husband kept on raving about it. Here are my changes, used ground turkey (dietary restrictions) instead of beef, portobello mushroom ravioli &amp; low fat shredded Italian blend cheese, little Romano cheese, Tuscan herb mixture.  Cooked the ground turkey then added the pasta sauce to it in the same pot. Followed the recipe from there &amp; sprinkled 2 tablespoons of grated Romano cheese on top.  I made this yesterday morning and left it in the fridge, brought it to room temp. 2 hours before baking.  Frankly, I rather make this than lasagna, since its easier, lighter &amp; tastier.  Patricia, thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe.  This is a keeper in my recipe file.",2,2,positive

"So much better than Reese&#39;s! These are so yummy! I used an actual teaspoon to drop out the chocolate mixture (it was nice and runny) and used a baby spoon for the peanut butter mixture just to make sure I eyeballed it correctly. I halved the recipe and still came out with 24 cups. I am definitely making these again! Super easy, too.",2,2,positive

"This is very good and is always a staple at our Thanksgiving table.  Everyone loves it, but I do add strips of green, yellow, and red bell peppers for color and taste, as  well as diced onions.  My recipe was nearly identical from an insert in our electric bill, but called for two cans of whole kernel, and two cans of cream style, plus 1/2 cup Flour rather than the cornbread mix.  Delicious nevertheless.",2,2,positive
"Mouthwatering! I substituted boneless, skinless chicken for bone-in. It is less likely to dry out during grilling. I also grilled rings of fresh pineapple, basting with butter and brown sugar. Served with coconut rice. You&#39;ll want leftovers!",2,2,positive
"This is the best peanut butter fudge I&#39;ve ever had! I have been making it for several years now since my 14 year-old was in the 3rd grade. His teacher at the time still talks about how great it is and she now makes it for all her co-workers at Christmas. I am getting ready to make it right now! For those who have had problems with it setting up, the only time that ever happened to me was the first time I made it-I didn&#39;t cook it for the full 3 minutes. Make sure you time it or it will not set up. Don&#39;t give up, though, just try it again and it will be perfect!!",2,2,positive
This soup is amazing!! I used it to make green bean casserole and I will never buy canned cream of mushroom soup again. I&#39;m going to try making cream of chicken soup next. I never realized what a difference the homemade version would be. Thanks so much for the killer recipy.,2,2,positive
"Very good Lasagna.  I was surprised it was done in that short amount of time, but it was.  I used spaghetti sauce as suggested by other reviews and used a slow cooker liner which made it easy to remove and made cleanup a breeze.  Not sure what I&#39;m going to with all the leftovers as it&#39;s just my husband and me.  I&#39;ll let it cool overnight and split it up in another 3 portions.

It soaked it up and was no longer soup the next day.  It was easy enough to thin out with more stock, but the rice got a little mushy.  Still good and none went to waste!",2,2,positive
"The dumplings took a little longer than the recipe said, they were very pasty looking, but tasted very good. I subbed corn for carrots ( I didn&#39;t have any carrots!) and it turned out really good. Even my picky six year old really like this, I would make it again for sure.",2,2,positive

I added six chopped smallish red potatoes, 4 carrots cut into 1/2 inch pieces, a sliced stalk of celery and a few Tbsp. Minced garlic and a sliced onion.  I added 1/2 cup red cooking wine as well. I also thickened it with a slurry of flour and water. It turned out delicious. The only thing I would do differently is leave out the onion. For some reason, I am not too pleased with the taste of onions in all the slow cooker recipes I have tried. This is delicious though. I sliced up one of the roasts and have it keeping warm in the gravy, and the other I set aside in my fridge.",0,2,positive

"**something changed. I came back here to get a reminder of how to make it, and half-and-half is on the recipe. Doubted my memory and used the half and half. It was so unremarkably bland and THIN. Heavy Cream makes all the difference in the world. Possibly this recipe was tweaked since I saved it? Would rate it 3 stars as-is. Fine for a way to use up mushrooms, but nothing I would serve for a special meal. Use the original heavy cream if you want 5 stars.(previous review) I am trying to let the soup finish cooking, but can&#39;t help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove. I think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right. The mushrooms can&#39;t be plain white mushrooms. Their flavor is half the taste. I used Crimean but would have loved to use portabella/baby bellas. I also used sweet onions. (Peruvian) I cannot imagine using white or yellow with this. admittedly I fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole, and it has plenty of onion flavor in it. Also, at the suggestion of a friend, I added a roux. Accidently made it very dark, but the toasted flavor was perfect. my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so I omitted salt and pepper. Simply amazing.",1,1,neutral

"I have been on the hunt for a good banana bread recipe. My husband has hated every recipe I have made and only likes his grandmas. I got his grandmas recipe and made it. And guess what? Did it turn out like grandmas? No. I tried this recipe last night. I used 3/4 of the all mixed, finished batter and put hat into a  loaf pan. The remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins. I did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs. This recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans. But my sister swore by this. No the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked. This was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan. I sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist. Most breads come out too dry when I use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time. My sister was right. Thanks sis! The bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this AMAZING recipe.

"I followed this recipe exactly as instructed. I didn&#39;t beat the egg whites. I didn&#39;t add chocolate or pecans or any other bells and whistles. The macaroons were crunchy around the edges, fluffy and moist on the inside and simply delicious. I mixed everything rapidly in a little bowl, by hand, and popped the dollops into the oven for 20 minutes. Hey presto! Macaroons that would give Earth Fare&#39;s a run for their money. My husband loved them. Thank you so much for sharing this -- you deserve that first-place ribbon.",2,2,positive

Used both sausage and bacon.  Delicious.,2,2,positive
I&#39;m giving 4 stars only because my bottom tortilla got too crispy to cut which made it messy. I also substituted pintos for the black beans. Great flavor but may try cutting tortillas into strips as Ceannze mentioned.,2,2,positive

This is an answer to 1camsgram question regarding where cream is used.  I&#39;m thinking it is used at serving time of the cobbler.  In the ingredients list it is half &amp; half CREAM.  In the directions it is referred to as CREAM on top of cold or hot cobbler. I&#39;m guessing it is poured on as desired.  It quite easily could be replaced with ice cream or a whipped topping.  Hope this helps.,2,0,negative

"I&#39;m not gluten free, but I wanted to try a gluten free recipe and settled with this one. I halved the original recipe and baked just one loaf. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. At first, just looking at the texture of a slice, I thought I wouldn&#39;t like it at all. But, I tried it and it tasted great! It was moist, and the flavors are spot on.",2,2,positive
"Given the great reviews and high rating I had great hopes for this recipe.  Followed it exactly, and cannot figure out what all the hype is about.  Very pedestrian.  No one liked it, and all agreed it was &#34;missing a lot of something.&#34; The chicken was very bland even though I used a very good Parmesan that I grated specifically for this recipe, and added some salt (I season everything) to the flour.  The &#34;bruschetta&#34; on top was just garlicky tomatoes.  Definitely deleting this one from the &#34;recipes to try&#34; file!",0,1,neutral
"This is the best bread I’ve ever made.  Found this recipe about 3weeks ago and just made my 7th batch this morning, hubby can’t stop eating this.",2,2,positive
"Absolutely love this! It was also actually easy to make. No hidden steps in between the other steps to prepare food for cooking. Used pre-chopped container of onion, and pre-minced garlic to make this even faster with no chopping. Made exactly per recipe (using sweet italian sausage) -- no swapping out water for more chicken broth, and it was perfect. If I had made that swap, as some readers did, it would have been too potent for our taste. Recipe perfect as is.",2,2,positive

"Made this today for a group of cowboys, to go along with chili and cornmeal muffins. It was well received! This will be my go to salad recipe from now on! I may add cubed cheddar cheese for the next time and for a more summer type salad I&#39;ll try adding sliced grapes. Oh so yummy. Thank you!",2,2,positive

I LOVE making this recipe.  It is ssoo easy and tastes great.  I sometimes make it when taking a meal to someone.  It is always so well received.,2,2,positive
"Very good with a little tweaking. I added a 1/2 cup of half and half to the cheese sauce and that gave it just the right consistency. I gently stirred the cheddar into the finished sauce off heat until melted, instead of tossing it with the pasta, and that worked out fine. I found it was easier to mix the sauce and the pasta together in a large bowl before transferring to baking dish (11x13 pan worked fine). I also sprinkled a liberal helping of shredded cheddar cheese over the top prior to baking.",2,2,positive
Excellent! Goes really good with a little half&amp;half. I had really sweet South Carolina peaches so I cut the sugar and brown sugar and water in half. Also deleted the nutmeg and cinnamon. We like a lot of crust so next batch plan to double the flour mixture. Easy to make and just a wonderful cobbler. Definitely a keeper!,2,2,positive
"I sauteed a little bit of onions in the butter and used light cheese and skim milk, omitted the salt and thought it was still great!",2,2,positive
"Okay...this wasn&#39;t my favorite recipe ever, but it satisfied a major Mexican food craving tonight. I made it with corn tortillas, and the flavor was good. Worth making. I think I&#39;d prefer even a bit more cheese next time. Gooey is good.",2,2,positive

I just had my first piece.  Absolutely delicious.  Even my husband (the skeptic) loves it.  Thank you so much,2,2,positive
I made this over the holiday and guests really liked it.  I thought it was too rich with all the bacon and cheese.  Next time I&#39;d probably half the bacon and increase the amount of hash browns in the recipe.  I also used 2% cottage cheese.,2,2,positive
this always go fast in my house!  easy to put together with ingredients typically one hand... win win recipe!,2,2,positive
"These were fantastic!  Everyone who has tried them wants more than one.  The recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes, but in the future think I will cut the frosting in half.  There was A LOT of it left over.",2,2,positive
Even my very fussy daughter liked this!  A great sidedish for when everyone&#39;s tired of the more usual veggies.  And it&#39;s a pudding in the same way a plum pudding is called a pudding.  A more British version of pudding than what most Americans envision.,2,2,positive
"Great recipe, simple and very tasty. I will definetly add this to my go-to meals!",2,2,positive
"Creamy indeed. I love the slightly  sharp edge that the Sour cream adds to this recipe. It seems to lighten up the heaviness that Mayonnaise can sometimes add to a recipe. Due to health issues I did not use any salt at all.  I used Celery Seed, and I  cut back  on the sugar. And to liven  it up even more some Cider Vinegar. Some freshly grinded Black Pepper completes this tasty side dish. One of our favorites during the summer.  I know my family is really going to enjoy this one. Its  a keeper.JanieTaste of Home Volunteer Field Editor",2,2,positive
"This recipe finally got my husband to eat zucchini!  Not only that, he&#39;s been requesting it at least once a week since I discovered it on your site a few months ago.  Getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge, but we started using a hand-held ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time.  It makes a huge difference, and I find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well.  I toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor, and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce (ground chicken, turkey, beef . . . even elk!) and it has come out fantastic every time.  It only gets better the longer you let it cook!",2,2,positive

"This is the best seafood lasagna that I have ever had, my family loved it! I did add a small amount of garlic powder for a bit more flavor, other than that I followed the recipe as written. Can&#39;t wait to make it again! Next time,I might try to lighten it up a bit.",2,2,positive
"These are EXCEPTIONAL.  Just perfect.   I used Organic UNSWEETENED coconut flakes (trader joe\&#39;s), and used 1/3 cup sugar with an extra small teaspoon since the coconut was unsweetened.     Since my coconut flakes were extremely dry I just added a couple of drops (literally) of water and crushed the flakes a bit more/ tossing and softening them just a bit before adding everything else.    My egg whites were cold not room temperature (i was impatient ha)  and I whisked them with them with the vanilla.     They were absolutely AMAZING - perfectly crisp on the outside and perfectly light and yet moist on the inside.  DELICIOUS!   DEFINITELY DESERVED YOUR BLUE RIBBON AWARD AT THE FAIR!!!

One thing that I did to save time was to use a 2 pound bag of hashbrowns instead of peeling and chopping the potatoes. I also cooked 6 or 8 strips of baccon, broke it apart and sprinkled the cooked bacon pieces as a garnish.  It was a hit!!",2,2,positive

I can\&#39;t figure out why this is getting less than 5 stars. It was amazing! Not wet or runny at all. I used a double crust (store bought) and 5 granny Smith apples. I followed the recipe as written. Scratching my head about these other reviews. It turned out fabulous.,2,2,positive

I love this recipe. I  used   Tree  colored pasta. Also no bacon  used  one small can of sliced  Black olives. It gave it a  meaty  taste without all that bacon I am  trying  to watch  my sodium intake.   Yum. I love the fact you use a lot less mayonnaise than the traditional macaroni salad recipes,0,2,positive

"To make this a &#34;one disher&#34; versus two dishes, I made the dressing first, in a Rubbermaid type container, then added the cabbage mixture. I can flip it every so often in the fridge til dinner time, instead of stirring it.I&#39;ve made it several times since then, and we&#39;ve enjoyed it. We enjoy a hint of vinegar (lime juice, or other acidic) to cut down on the overall sweetness, so I did add that, in the additional makings.  I also cut down on the sugar ever so slightly (personal preference, not the recipe&#39;s fault).To make the slaw the star, we make tortillas on these hot summer nights, using this slaw, a tortilla wrap, and leftover grilled pork (though shrimp, fish, or chicken are all okay, too).Thanks for sharing this recipe. Sorry I did make the modifications, so it isn&#39;t really the original, but, I hate doing dishes, so, I try to conserve whenever possible.",2,2,positive
Very Good loved the topping,2,2,positive
I would recommend cooking it an additional 20-25 minutes. I really liked my apples soft like apple pie and the topping more caramelized. It was fantastic!,2,2,positive
I have made this for Christmas morning the last two years.  It is a hit.  I substitue Monterey Jack for the Swiss.  And I cook the bacon and onion up the night before and measure out the other ingredients in a large bowl.  Basically do everything except add the eggs.  I do that in the morning.  I get it out a few minutes earlier and bake it a little longer.  Works really well.,2,2,positive

"Absolutely yummy! Made it twice over the weekend. I omitted the carrots, mushrooms, &amp; crumbled bacon to suit my husband&#39;s taste and just used shredded cheddar cheese instead of process cheese and it was excellent. I also used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken it up to save on some carbs. Super quick and easy as well. My husband absolutely loved it as did my son. Definitely is going into the &#34;keeper&#34; file.",2,2,positive
"Made this for dinner tonight and my husband devoured all of it!  I served it with hot mustard and Hoisin sauce on the side.

"I did not change a thing.  These were super yummy, a nice way to turn a simple sandwich into a meal.  I really liked how the bottoms of the sandwiches got nice &amp; crispy while the tops were soft &amp; pillowy.  The sauce was hard to pour so that each sandwich got a similar amount of stuff, but in the end after baking, it all evened out in the pan.  I put them in the fridge for a good part of the day &amp; not overnight &amp; they were fine.  Make the sauce first, assemble the sandwiches &amp; pour your sauce.  I used Sandwich Pal horseradish sauce &amp; it was perfect.  You could eat the onion sauce with a spoon.  I will make these again &amp; I might try the Reuben idea too.",2,2,positive

I have to join the other 5 star raters with this one.  Its very rich and wonderful. Impressive and very satisfying.  I did use a few suggestions. I feel that this recipe will do just fine with just 2 seafood choices.  If  Crab is one of them Use fresh.  Next time I will just use shrimp &amp; Crab. I also reduced the clam juice and used a dry sherry.This recipe will serve quite a few so I downsized it to just 2.I also feel that this would be perfect for stuffing pasta shells *  Next time for sure.JanieTaste of Home Volunteer Food Editor.,2,2,positive
So happy the sauce is homemade instead of using canned soup which is full of things I don&#39;t want to put in my body.,2,2,positive
"1 important point that was missed. The mixed ingredients should be completely cool before folding in the whipped topping. Actually, in my case, I let the gelatin mixture completely cool before adding in the cold yogurt. That way the whipped topping retains more of its volume. I made this and it was very good. Not as good a real key lime pie, but way less calories.",0,2,positive

The amount of water seems problematic to me, I put the amount indicated and the bater became so watery, but decided to give it a shot. After 35 minutes of baking the cake was still SUPER watery, so I put it an other 10 minutes, and still watery. It ended up staying in the oven for more than an hour until a toothpick came out clean. The cake came out actually kind of dry instead of moist. Can someone tell me what I did wrong?",0,0,negative

My husband loves the recipe and so do I...this is a definite keeper and our families will be enjoying it in the future!  I followed the recipe, but also added a little lime juice to increase the &#34;tang factor.&#34;",2,2,positive
"I loved this recipe! I say “loved” because…something got changed. Can someone help me out? It was SO thick this time I made it,  and I hate ginger, so there definitely was none in there before whatever changes got put into this recipe… anybody have the original recipe from before? Cuz it was the best apple pie I’d ever had!",1,2,positive
"The crust - a mix of graham crackers and oreos - is what sets this cheesecake apart from the rest.  It is delicious!  My mother-in-law loves peanut butter and she can&#39;t get enough of this rich, creamy cheesecake.",2,2,positive
OMG!  I make this all the time!  It is wonderfull!,2,2,positive
"Fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!!!  I rate this as a full five star recipe. It just was not letting me do the star rating part. Furthermore, I have been making this for years and everyone loves it. I actually searched it just to give it a rating. I initially got it from the taste of home magazine. Everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe and I never have left overs. My husband actually asks me to make batch for the house and the bbq so he can have some when he wants a snack later because he knows it will be gone before we get home. I have even have people complain that I did not make enough because it is gone before they can even dish their plate at the bbqs. It is a keeper!!!!!!!!! I did not put celery in it or the pepper. I also let the bacon and veggies sit in sauce for five ten minutes before I pour over the noodles and I think it makes for better flavor.",2,2,positive
Absolutely the BEST chicken pot pie recipe. I made a few minor adjustments based on ingredients I had at home. Throwing out my old recipe. This is the cat’s meow!,2,2,positive
Wonderfully flavored cake. I followed the advice of one reviewer by adding the vanilla after I added the hot milk and butter. I baked it for 35 minutes and dusted the top with powdered sugar.,2,2,positive
This chili was phenominal!  It was so easy to make and was so flavorful.  The only addition I did was to add a minced jalapeno pepper!  My family loved it! I will definitely make it again!!!,2,2,positive
"this recipe was very easy and looks good.  I only changed one thing and that was just using half the salt which happens to be way too much also.  you should add salt last, the cheese can have lots of salt and the butter too.  It is ruined and will go in the trash and I hate wasting food.  sad sad",1,0,negative
Already made it three times.  Use Hellmann&#39;s and apple cider vinegar.,2,0,negative
"I love cherry desserts, and I wanted this recipe to be as delicious and special as so many reviews said; however, it was so plain tasting.",0,1,neutral
"This IS the best potato soup ever, a family favorite!",2,2,positive
My husband told me this recipe was a keeper and i can&#39;t take the leftovers to work. I am really glad I picked this recipe to try. We loved it!!!,2,2,positive
"I made this and it is easy, delicious and a favorite on a cold day.",2,2,positive
This looked so good but turned out runny in the middle even though I baked until golden brown per the recipe.  Did anyone else have this problem?,0,0,negative
I&#39;m thinking 1 hour is too long to cook these chops.  I think I would just brown the chops and put them on top of my scalloped potatoes that have been in the oven for awhile and let everything finish at the same time.,1,0,negative
This soup was amazing!  I did use low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and bullion.  This was so good served w/ some great sea salt and garlic pita crackers!,2,2,positive
This soup was very good.  I accidentally picked up “Italian diced stewed” tomatoes but it still very good.  I will be making this many more times.  Thanks so much for the recipe.,2,2,positive
"Very good enchilada recipe, I was looking for something better than past recipes &amp; this will the one I use from now on.",2,2,positive
This was absolutely wonderful....I just substituted turkey for the turkey sausage...I hate sausage..WONDERFUL!,2,2,positive
Good way to work some veggies into our diet.,2,2,positive
Completely underwhelmed with the recipe as written. Not enough flavor. Only thing I did differently was add garlic while sauteing the onions.  I wont be making this again.,1,1,neutral
"I  definitely will make this recipe again. It is a  delicious pie, wonderful taste and texture.  I have prepared and carried the pie to several gatherings. Was enjoyed by all an there were  no leftovers. After reading several of the ratings, the problem may be the baking   temperature used  was not as printed as well as the proper chilling time.  My pies always look like the pictureyou show.",2,2,positive
"Hmmm, thought I had reviewed this b4. Going to make it again, probably using corn tortilla as b4, frying them slightly, making my own enchilada sauce, and not sure about which beans I&#39;ll use but tried black beans last time and liked. Both dh &amp; I enjoyed this a lot.",2,2,positive
This is a great recipe everyone in house loved it which is odd in our family to get everyone who agrees.  Will make it again.,2,2,positive
"Excellent!  I made a half-recipe for the two of us and served it with cheese-and-salsa rice.  DH  thought it was terrific, too.  Another keeper from ToH.",2,2,positive
"Easy recipe, it tasted really good.  Excellent flavor.  My only issue was that it was more soup than chili, which many other reviewers said.  It would be nice if it were quite a bit thicker.  Then I would have given it 5 stars.  I did really like it, and I will probably monkey with the recipe some more.",2,2,positive
"We LOVED this recipe, I added1 Tbl of Worchester (our old favorite mac &amp; cheese recipe has it), shared with a neighbor who loved it too &amp; wanted the recipe.  It&#39;s a keeper!!Sheri K",0,2,positive

I made this for Easter Brunch. It definitely deserves 5 stars!! It fed a crowd. Adults and children ate it all.  I did not have cottage cheese on hand but used Ricotta cheese which I did have on hand. It would have been a little more moist if I had used cottage cheese which I will do next time. I put it together the day before and refrigerated it overnight. Perfect. Great Recipe!! Delicious. This will be my go to breakfast casserole (to serve alongside Pillsbury&#39;s French Toast Bake Casserole and a Virginia baked ham).,2,2,positive
"This is indeed a wonderful banana bread recipe. My sister who hates bananas even had to admit that it was good! I did however read lots of reviews before making and I used only 1 cup of sugar. (1/2 brown &amp; 1/2 gran. sugar) And because I did not have buttermilk, I substituted with sour cream as suggested. And likewise with the walnuts. I only had pecans. The 1st time I tried the recipe I used an 11 cup pyrex dish as I saw that it made a really big loaf. I started to moniter the baking process at approx. 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick. This time I doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before, except I used only 3 bananas (only had that many) and baked in a 13 x 9. I also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting. It was crispy around the edges, which made it taste even better. Moist cake textured bread. Definitely a keeper.",2,2,positive
"Absolutely Fantastic!! Followed the recipe exactly, it was really delicious.  Definitely will make again.",2,2,positive
THIS ROCKED!  It was so easy to make and everyone I have made it for raves about how yummy it tastes!!!,2,2,positive
This was excellent! And it was a hit with the family!,2,2,positive
Big hit at work.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I added chopped walnuts to the top of the frosting.  I also cut back on the confectionary sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  I used 3 bananas.,2,2,positive
"I&#39;m not use to baking with zucchini so I have to ask, do you peel it before you shred it, or leave the peeling on?  Thank you for your time.",0,0,negative
Delicious and easy to make!,2,2,positive
I&#39;ve used this recipe several times.  I love it!   I use it for turkey pot pies too and adjust the herbs.  It is an excellent way to use up roast turkey and freeze pies for later.,2,2,positive
"Absolutely Delicious!   Reading all the reviews, I have to say Ditto.  Excellent, fantastic, wonderful, wouldn&#39;t change a thing.  I did chop my chicken that was par-cooked instead of cubing it, however, and cooked in Crock Pot - 45 minutes on High, then about 3 hours on Low.  My 11-year-old is picky and didn&#39;t seem thrilled about white chili.  He Now says it&#39;s the best thing in the world and he could eat it every night.  It went great with tortilla chips, too!",2,2,positive
"This was just an AMAZING pumpkin bread recipe. I didn&#39;t even notice that you were not supposed to use the whole can of pumpkin and it turned out delicious. I added a spiced citrus glaze on top along with a few pumpkin seeds, and let me tell you that was the best decision of my life!!!",2,2,positive
This is always a hit with our family. Someone makes it for every gathering.,2,2,positive
"I made this recipe and made some adjustments, and it was delicious! Since I smoke my own bacon, I sliced what would equal about four thick slices and chopped them before I cooked them until crisp. I used two small russet potatoes and real half and half.  Instead of topping the servings with the crumbled bacon, I added it to the mixture at the same time as the clams.  I served it with oyster crackers and Tabasco!  Awesome!!!  It was even better the second day heated slowly over medium low heat.",2,2,positive
"I have made this soup twice now. Love the flavours! I do find that it is a bit thin for a creamy soup. I tried pureeing some of the cauliflower and adding it back in, but I think next time I make it I will try reducing the amount of water used to cook the vegetables. Overall a yummy soup recipe!",2,2,positive
My husband has been making this for 3-4 years thanks to Nigella Lawson! Her recipe was talked about on NPR and he tracked down the recipe. Love it!,2,2,positive
this definitely is yummy but I do have to say it will be named corncake with a slash in my recipe file. I do wonder if people saying cornbread from the south is dry is because of #1) in the north they rarely use real good ole-bacon grease. and REAL buttermilk. so this is1. #2) most southerners that I grew up with counted on eating a slice from a cast-iron skillet( the best way to stay moist and have a crispy crust.) ,2,2,positive
Excellent recipe!! My husband loves cookies with ginger and molasses and these were a huge hit. I didn&#39;t make any changes to the recipe. Watch the cooking time closely. I took them out of the oven after 11 minutes. I was concerned they may not be fully done but they were perfect!! They&#39;ve stayed nice and soft. Definitely added this to my favorite recipes.,2,2,positive
"Excellent recipe!  I think I used a 2 quart dish, so it took longer to bake, but it was a great, sweet-tasting corn dish.",2,2,positive
No way too many calories for one slice of cake!,0,0,negative
"I have made this cake a couple of times!  It was really good.  One thing I did leave out the second time was the 1/2 cup of milk in the frosting.  The frosting, to me, did not need the milk.  it was much easier to work with without it!  But a great cake!",2,2,positive
"Simple... moist... tasty... meatloaf... Also, recommend meat mixture for italian meatballs... Dott",2,0,negative
Didn’t have 3 pounds chicken but made rest of recipe with full amounts used Splenda brand brown sugar with half the sugar instead of white sugar. I am diabetic after chemo and radiation so try to cut sugar when I can!  I got a new crock pot and set it for 5 hours time. Had bone in thighs. Keep taking lid off and flipping thighs to keep ladling sauce on top several times during cooking. When I went to remove chicken with two tine fork it fell apart and the bone fell back into pot!   Oh my gracious the sauce is good enough to eat by itself lol!!  Fantastic recipe. Made baby broccoli florets with sharp cheddar cheese instead of rice  It was a great meal. So easy to make!!! Thanks for sharing with us!!!,2,2,positive
EXCELLENT AND EASY TO MAKE!  I thought the 400 degree oven temp excessive so I baked at 350 degrees for the specified time.   Also spread a little salsa on bottom of casserole dish.  No burning or crisp tortillas.  This dish is definitely a &#34;keeper&#34; .  Next time I will kick it up a little by adding some green chiles and/or chipotle chiles in adobe to mix.,2,2,positive
"I have made this recipe multiple times and our Ladies Sunday School Class asks for it everytime there is a ladies brunch, etc.   I use a pound of real bacon bits instead of cooking up bacon, dried onion pieces can be used in place of chopped onion, I increase the eggs to 12, use 1 package of shredded hash brown potatoes (16-20 oz package from the refrigerator section), I chop up sliced swiss cheese since I can never find shredded Swiss already packaged and make no changes on the cottage cheese.   This casserole is a big hit and by using some of the easier ways to get ingredients it is not hard to make.  I have never tried to freeze this but since I am making one for Sunday I may try freezing a small amount to see how it holds up.",2,2,positive
This recipe was delicious. A new addition to our Thanksgiving dinner and an instant favorite. I did modify slightly by only adding 1/2 cup of sugar and I substitute a can of kernel corn for frozen corn. Not to sweet and a great texture!,2,2,positive
"Even though some reviewers said it was too salty, I decided to make it as it was written (FYI the env. of ranch dressing mix I used was 1 oz, the env. of  Italian salad dressing mix was 0.7 oz. and the env. of brown gravy mix was 0.87 oz. (The brands I used are well known). After pouring the mixure over the meat, I added cut potates and carrots on top (many reviewers suggested adding these vegetables).  IT CAME OUT PERFECT AND NOT SALTY AT ALL!    My husband rated it EXCELLENT!",0,2,positive
Very easy and so delicious!,2,2,positive
"Bush used to have a white chili bean and it made this recipe super simple. I’ve written to them and asked them to please!, bring them back",2,2,positive
This recipe has great reviews because it is a great recipe! So simple and easy yet so delicious! I just added a touch of salt and pepper. Perfect for brunch!,2,2,positive
Very delicious. A little too spiced for my family so next time I’ll cut the red pepper flakes in half. Otherwise a very easy dish to make.,2,2,positive
Very good as is.  I have used chicken broth instead of bouillon.  You can add in any little dabs of leftover veggies to use them up and it is still good.,2,2,positive
This was SOOO good! Everything was so moist and delicious! I made it for the first time 2 nights ago...and my fiance requested that I make it again the very next night! This is deff. one of the best recipe&#39;s I have ever cooked!,0,2,positive
"This recipe looks pretty clear to me. I usually chill my cookie dough for10-15 minutes while I preheat the oven. This will keep your cookies from spreading too much. Also, 3/4 tsp isn’t an unusual  amount. Most bakers have 1/2",0,0,negative
"I just want to say that &#34;Shirley&#34; and &#34;vsailaway&#34; are WRONG. This recipe is, hands down, the best chocolate cake recipe I&#39;ve ever used. The three cups brown sugar is NOT too much for a cake of this volume. My cake has always come out great. The only thing I change is I use cake flour, softassilk brand.",2,2,positive
Tried this dish tonight and I personally enjoyed it! It was quick and easy another keeper.,2,2,positive
I&#39;ve been making this almost every year since is appeared in the TOH magazine. I remember how &#34;wowed&#34; we were at the first bite. I haven&#39;t met a person yet who didn&#39;t love this prize-winning chunky apple cake. It definitely is a fall-time favorite in this house! Mmmmmm good! And the sauce is so delish. :),2,2,positive
My sister and brother-in-law rated this recipe Yum! Yum!,2,2,positive
The cake itself was excellent and I will absolutely make again. Very thick three layers and super moist. I was not thrilled with the frosting. It has a sharp taste to it possibly from the sour cream. It ended up tasting primarily like powdered sugar/sour  instead of being chocolatey like I was hoping. Nonetheless I received many compliments and as some other commenters have said it does keep well for several days.,2,2,positive
I have been making this since 1994. It&#39;s a favorite for the whole family and others who have it here for dinner ask for the recipe.,2,2,positive

"This bread was so delicious and moist! I think I used chopped pecans in my first batch and we didn&#39;t really like them. Next time I may try another nut or just leave them off entirely. I also added some nutmeg and cloves to bring out some of the flavor, and next time I may add more pumpkin spice, nutmet and cloves next time to see if it helps bring out the flavor. Other than that, this was a GREAT recipe that I will be making again in the fall!",1,2,positive
"absolutely delicious! If you like, use shredded cooked chicken in the filling (add after the onions are cooked in a little olive oil) instead of the beef. Substitute chicken broth for the beef broth.",2,2,positive
A family favorite!! My son asks over and over to make this. Wonderful flavor!,2,2,positive
Delicious! Both my mom and I have made this many times.  The only change we make is to use 2 cans of whole kernel corn and leave out the creamed corn.  Great side for a holiday or company meal!,2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve also been making these bars since they first came out in the magazine. They are outstanding! Creamy, rich, with a wonderful texture. Loved by young and old, they are even requested for birthdays!",2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve been baking this every week since finding the recipe and everyone I&#39;ve given it to has raved.  I modified it a little in that I add 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of cloves.  I use an &#34;all-in-one&#34; GF product which tends to yield a product which is a bit too heavy and doesn&#39;t rise as well as with regular wheat flour.  The 1/2 tsp of baking powder makes a big difference, and the small amounts of spices bring out the richness of flavor.",2,2,positive
I made this pie for our family reunion last week.  It went like crazy!  My sons girlfriend asked me to make one just for her the minute we got home.  I have had so many requests for this recipe since then.  This pie will definitely be on the Thanksgiving menu!,2,2,positive
"Fantastic bread recipe. It takes our family about three days to go through a loaf of bread so I refrigerated half the dough after kneading it the first time. It continues to rise in the fridge so make sure you put it in a container with room for it to double and a tight fitting lid. Took it out today, punched it down, shaped for the second loaf and continued the recipe from there - it turned out perfectly!",2,2,positive
"My husband loved this recipe.  I have never used provolone in lasagna before.  It was great.  We have tried adding torn spinach as one of the layers, comes out great.",2,2,positive
"Thank you Debbie for sharing your recipe.  It is amazing!  Very easy to put together.  Made it to give friends, they absolutely love it, I used about 3/4 cup of peanut butter, just because I wanted to empty the jar!  Great recipe!",2,2,positive
Loved the flavor - only change I made was that I used cherries from a neighbors tree and made my own filling instead of purchased canned filling,2,2,positive
"Favorite at our home, but I leave the salt to everyone&#39;s discretion.",2,2,positive
This was my 1st time cooking anything remotely Mexican food. I wanted to learn how to make this for a dinner date. I done a test run and it turned out delicious! I however didn’t have time to marinate so I just slow cooked the chicken while letting it absorb the seasoning. I also added barbecue sauce in. I will definitely be making this again.,2,2,positive
"This is a recipe we have made and enjoyed many times. Easy, tasty, lasts good in the fridge and healthy.  Who could ask for more?",2,2,positive
LOVE this recipe! Low carb (I&#39;m diabetic) and so easy to sub lowfat ingredients.I made mine with low fat cheeses and ground turkey breast. Everyone loved it!,2,2,positive
"This is absolutely delicious! Comfort food at its best.  Added  four cups of potatoes  but other than that , followed recipe. Made 3 pot pies. Will definitely be making again",0,2,positive
"Love this soup, but I add frozen chopped spinach to it as my family likes more vegies.",2,2,positive
Great soup recipe.,0,2,positive
"Love, love, LOVE this! I used a combo of types of mushrooms made a slurry of the mushroom mixture, flour and 2 cups of the chicken stock to cook out the flour taste.  Warmed the remaining stock and then added the slurry to the hot stock; stir often until thickened THEN add the cream and turn down to med/low and let simmer. A few extra steps but OH SO WORTH IT!",2,2,positive
"Don&#39;t mess with perfection. if you are looking for a really good Christmas bread or anytime, this takes 1st place. i did omit raisons and nuts as I don&#39;t want any other flavors interfering with my pumpkin. Even the ends are good and was not as oily as other recipes I&#39;ve tried.",2,2,positive
"This is a great recipe, I used one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other seasonings and probably should have used a little more but it is really good.",2,2,positive
I made some mashed potatoes and served the meat over the potatoes and there were no leftovers!  I used beef stock instead of water and this was the most flavorful roast I&#39;ve ever had.  Definitely making it again!,2,2,positive
"These bars are exceptional!  Soooo delicious! I made these bars and took them to church. I had so many people come up to me and tell me just how yummy they are. I made these exactly as the recipe states, except I used blackberry pie filling instead of the cherry. Thank you!",2,2,positive
This was the best cake I&#39;d ever made.So delicios,2,2,positive
Hands down the BEST Mac&amp;Cheese recipe!!! The entire family LOVED it!!! It is very creamy and smooth! Instead of Velveeta cheese I used Medium Cheddar and I doubled the amount of Parmesan cheese. I also used heavy cream instead of milk. You only need about 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.,2,2,positive
"I make a version of this with 1/2 cup each raisins and chopped walnuts.  Found that it works best with juicy apples; otherwise, too dry.  I think I used 4 red delicious apples last time. Oh, and 2 tsp of cinnamon helps to cut back on the sweetness.  It is a rich dessert, but yummy!",2,2,positive
I thought it was amazing and full of flavor.  Probably my favorite chowder recipe to make.,2,2,positive
I have not made this recipe but it sounds like a great way to make the cottage cheese mix in the lasagna. 5 stars for creativity. I can not wait to make it for my family.,2,2,positive

I&#39;ll be making these every year for the rest of my life, more than likely. : )",2,2,positive

"The sweetness of the cream cheese mixture and strawberries is a nice contrast to the saltiness and crunch of the pretzels. I&#39;ve made this recipe as a side dish, snack, and dessert!",2,2,positive
DH loved this. it was flavorful without being overly spicy. I also omitted the thickening step and did not miss it.,2,2,positive
"This cake was very moist with a light not very sweet frosting. I followed the recipe with the minor suggestion of adding a smidge more cocoa powder.  For anyone that might find this helpful: the cocoa powder was Hershey unsweetened, for the frosting I used unsalted butter and regular white sugar not confectioners. The frosting is enough to generously frost the whole cake.I baked in a 9x3 round pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sprayed Pam all over the pan. Baked at 325.it did not overflow... It baked maybe 45-1hr I didn&#39;t take the time. I also added strawberry filing with a thin layer of frosting in the middle as a personal preference but the cake itself is moist!",2,2,positive
Delicious.  My mom doubles the recipe and makes these for my kids - they love them!  They request them for dinner frequently.,2,2,positive
"This was excellent! The only adjustments I made were to use cheddar instead of velveeta, and because my granddaughter just had braces put on, I blended it with an immersion blender before adding the milk and cheese. It isn&#39;t exactly PRETTY, but the flavor is phenomenal.",2,2,positive
"very good, i used my squash instead of pumpkin. still tastes great.",2,2,positive
Love this recipe! Super tasty and is great as leftovers!,0,2,positive
"I found this soup so bland and runny. I even used Pepper Jack instead of cheddar. I don&#39;t understand what all the raves were about. Not yummy, just boring.",1,0,negative
I really love this recipe its one of my daughters favorites.  Only thing i altered on this recipe was the cooking time.  I only cooked it 3 hours instead of the recommended 4 and it did not burn in the bottom of my crock pot like it had previously when i made it and it was perfectly done.,2,2,positive
Amazing taste and extremely moist! A huge hit at work :),2,2,positive
"Good recipe, will make it again. Love the cilantro, and I also mashed half of the beans and added a little more sour cream.",2,2,positive
I made this last night for supper and it was delicious! I had made a roast the night before so I used my leftover carrots and potatos in this soup. Only thing is for our family next time I will add a bit more hamburger.,2,2,positive
"Absolutely outstanding! These fajitas are better than the ones at my favorite Mexican restaurant. I made the following modifications: tripled the bell pepper/onion and added a coarsely-chopped tomato during the last few minutes of cooking the chicken. I also used heaping measuring spoons of all the spices. Served with sour cream and guacamole salad, there were no leftovers!",2,2,positive
"I made this for my wife and I per recipe.  Served over rice and with stir fried vegetables.  It was great, and easy to make.",2,2,positive
"This was good except it was hard getting the bottom crust out  when cutting and serving. The next time I make this, I will cut the topping in half and only put in on the top of the apples. I will also cut down on the sugars as someone else did.",2,2,positive
Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare,2,2,positive

This was just terrific.  All the best flavors.  This will become a regular on our dinner table from here on.,2,2,positive
"I have made this cake ever since it came out in the cookbook back in about 1992. I love it! It is failproof. If you want it to fill a 13 x 9 full, just do one and a half batches of the recipe. After it cools, slice off the extra (it is the best part!) and then turn the cake out onto the cooling rack.",2,2,positive
Really good and easy.   I added chopped almonds and dipped the tops in chocolate.  They were like Almond Joys.,2,2,positive
I made this for a little &#34;bake-off&#34; with girls from work....it&#39;s the Best banana bread I&#39;ve ever made...and I bake A LOT! Just MAKE THIS one....you&#39;ll never look for a banana bread recipe again!,2,2,positive
"Our family loves this recipe so much that I keep the right amount of buttermilk frozen in baggies just so I will have it on hand when our bananas get a little too ripe and I make this bread. My grandson suddenly stopped eating bananas and as it turned out, he was letting them get &#34;too old&#34; so we would have banana bread!",2,2,positive
Made it in a 9x13 and came out great.  Hard to beat spiced cake and caramel frosting.  This will definitely be made again,2,2,positive
"Fantastic flavor, chowder consistency...my husband and I loved it and will make it again!",2,2,positive
"Double this, you won&#39;t regret it.  I did make modifications when doubling.  Tripled the clam juice and omitted the water.  Then, used heavy cream instead of the ff half &amp; half.  I used just a little water at the end to get the right consistency, but not nearly the doubled 2 cups--just a cup to clean out that heavy cream in the measuring cup.  I only had mini potatoes so I didn&#39;t peel, just cut them in quarters.  The skins remained on and added a color to the mix.  I also used Better Than Bouillon, Chicken Flavor which I think beats out granules any day.   A hit at euchre night!",2,2,positive
I followed the instructions as given except I made a topping to make it taste more like my wifes stuffed peppers. I used buttered croutons with some grated cheddar cheese. It was fantastic.! thanks .   jim,2,0,negative
My kids loved it. Especially my oldest daughter.,2,2,positive
I make this soup every winter. It is one of my husband &amp; mine favorite. I try to use also low fat cheddar or sharp cheese to cut more fat. I also use sodium reduce better than bouillon. If I have broccoli leftover from a prior dinner or have fresh will add it too.,2,2,positive
"My whole family loves this recipe, including my son who may just be the pickiest eater I have ever know. My only change was I had to use a 13x9 and add 15 minutes. I guess with it being smaller, the icing gets to be a little thick for my husband who doesn&#39;t have much of a sweet tooth but I love it. Thinking about adding some spices and nuts once just for fun, but definitely not necessary for this recipe.",2,2,positive
I like sour cream but I think 1 cup is too much. My batch tasted more like sour cream noodles than like chicken noodle soup.,1,1,neutral
"Turned out really good. I should&#39;ve formed mine better, I just dumped it in there so the top was a bit funky ;D I did halve this recipe. My first attempt at making bread and it makes me want to try other recipes! Really tasty, I&#39;m glad it was a success!",2,2,positive
easy and is very good,2,2,positive
This cake turned out great! Really moist and fudgy.  I did take others suggestions and use coffee instead of the water.  I can&#39;t rate the frosting though.  Some people said it tasted strange and I couldn&#39;t risk my picky eaters&#39; b-day cake tasting weird...,2,2,positive
"Delish!  Such an easy recipe, yet so good! My husband loved the mushrooms...and I did put extra in the dish.",2,2,positive
"Made these bars last nite, using bananas, that I had froze, but be sure to thaw them out good. Had them for a luncheon, today, very good and easy, will make again.",2,2,positive
Love love love this recipe! I do sauté my chicken remove from pan. Sauté garlic onion for about 1 minute then add celery and carrots until tender then I follow the recipe exactly after that. Well I guess Sometimes I add a little more water depending on my mood and sometimes I add more noodles and serve it over mashed potatoes. Regardless such a great recipe.,2,2,positive
Super easy to make and absolutely delicious!!  My husband does not like anything with cottage cheese but he didn’t even know there was any in it and he had three servings!!  This will be my new go to.,2,2,positive

I should&#39;ve reviewed this winner years ago; it&#39;s been my go to recipe for muffins for ages now.  I always add toasted walnuts or pecans plus some spices and sometimes I toss in whatever berries I have on hand.  Always delicious and not a single failure with this great and simple recipe.,0,2,positive
I just made these and the frosting seems awfully dense......shouldn&#39;t there be some milk or half and half mixed in with conf sugar to make it light and fluffy?,0,0,negative
This is fabulous!  I used skim milk and otherwise made as directed!,2,2,positive
I love this chili. The only change I made was to add a jalapeno with the seeds. My brother-in-law was asking me the other day to make that &#34;soup&#34; meaning chili that has the white beans. Ha! So I guess I&#39;ll make it again. Thank you.,2,2,positive
"Delicious!   And simple.   For the icing, I used granulated sugar and followed directions to a tee, using my wire whisk attachment on my mixer to beat for 10 minutes.  Did not turn out grainy at all.",2,2,positive

For those hung up on the color of this pie...Key lime pie really is not green unless food  color is used..Key lime pie is a pale yellow green.

One variation of this is to mix one small box of orange jello according to the box directions.  Let the jello cool and pour over baked cake that you poked holes in (you can use a fork to do this).  Frosting the cake and chill in the frig overnight.  It&#39;s tasty and pretty when you cut it!,0,2,positive

While prepping this, I popped my unwrapped peanut butter cups in the freezer while I worked on step 3. That way, they were firm and easier to chop.",2,2,positive
"This was delicious! I didn&#39;t have tilapia, so I made the recipe with sole, and I doubled the recipe for my larger family. I also used dill instead of oregano.  The sole had a lot of water in it, creating so much liquid that the fish was more poached than baked. When it was done, I thickened all the extra liquid with a little cornstarch and drizzled it over the fish .  Oh my gosh....it was so good! The combination of butter, lemon, dill and capers was fantastic! We will definitely be having this for dinner again soon!",2,2,positive
My Mother In Law made this for my husband and I to save for when I had my son.  A quick meal to heat up.   Since then I have made this 4x.  This is a great recipe.  The only thing I changed (based on personal preference) I added 3 cloves of garlic and fresh thyme and rosemary from my Garden. I also only used 1 stick of butter.  Great recipe.  Will continue to make,2,2,positive
We LOVE this recipe! I have made it 3 times in a few months. It is flavorful and delicious! Made homemade tortillas to use with it. We only add salsa &amp; sour cream .,2,2,positive
I work at a cafe that makes fresh pastries and desserts and when looking for recipes I settle for absolutely nothing less than the best. I have a very high standard and I was skeptical. But these were wonderful cookies and I admit that I ate them for dinner and then for breakfast the next day. I couldn&#39;t keep my paws off of them! They are not big like the recipe says but pressing down on them before baking does help a lot. These will definitely be going in my lineup at the cafe!,2,2,positive
I am not a baker BUT you don&#39;t have to be! These cookies I baked for church were fabulous and so easy!!! Rave reviews!!!,2,2,positive

"I&#39;ve made this soup twice--once with ground beef and once with a rotisserie chicken--and it is easily one of the best soup recipes I have ever made. I, too, add more liquid but follow the recipe otherwise. It&#39;s one of my new favorites! ",2,2,positive

"This recipe has been so popular.  So many great reviews. I am happy to finally be adding mine.  I can’t add much more then what has already been spoken for. It’s a greet good, satisfying soup. One that really matures overnight.It has the perfect name, it does taste like a stuffed pepper!  Due to some diet restrictions I made the following changes. No brown sugar or tomato sauce. I used 1 very large fresh tomato.  I used  a packet of beefy onion soup mix and added some Better Than Boullion Beef base to the mix. I upped the amount of green pepper and used less ground beef. And I used no rice.This is all about the beefy taste wrapped around Green Peppers.It was most enjoyable.TOH-VFE",2,2,positive
This is one of our regular meals. It&#39;s great as a leftover in a sandwich the next day. ,2,2,positive
"This soup is one of our favorites! I make it often in the winter. If there are any leftovers, which is rare, I put it in individual servings in the freezer for a quick lunch. The only change I make is that I add a full pound of hamburger. The carrots, onions, and celery give the soup a great flavor. I thought the basil was different, but it is excellent in the soup. The amount of cheese is just right, as it is not overly cheesy. I will definitely keep making this soup!",2,2,positive
Made for my by my aunt for brunch a few years back.  I reach for this recipe often.,2,2,positive
"Overall this soup turned out great! My only issue was that the 1 1/2 cups of water was not nearly enough liquid! I ended up adding about double that amount. I substituted beef broth for the water and it was a great addition. I also only used black beans, two cans, and I used a whole bag of frozen corn instead of canned. It was a huge hit with my whole family!",1,2,positive

"This is the best apple recipe ever!  There&#39;s no need to make an apple pie with crust after making this gem.  It is extremely simple and the taste is phenomenal.  If you love apple pie a la mode, this is the recipe for you!  I get requests for it over and over again.  The only change I make is adding an extra apple or so until the apples are piled high in the pan.  I also split the apple varieties and use honeycrisp and granny smith.  I use a little more granny smith than honeycrisp.  Usually about (3-4) honey crisps to (4-5) granny smiths - dependent on apple size.",2,2,positive
"Went camping, needed a good scampi recipe for 2lbs. I looked over many. This is the one. Only added 1/4+ white wine WITH lemon juice, and cooked it in a frying pan instead of the broiler. Was absolutely fantastic! Plenty of great flavors. Very easy to make. The zinger here really is the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Adds additional flavor and soaks up all the good stuff. I will be putting this one in my dinner rotation.",2,2,positive
"This is a delicious casserole!  It does take some prep work before baking, but well worth it.  We found it to be dry the first time, so we like to double the sauce.",2,2,positive

"I made this tonight, and it was delicious.  I didn&#39;t have any sour cream but I had plain non fat greek yogurt, so I added that.  I used a full pound of hamburger, 4c of broth and 2c of milk so it would yield more servings for my family.  I also added some green onion at the end for garnish.  Overall, this is a great soup and I will make it again!! Oh, and it wasn&#39;t too cheesy either!",2,2,positive

I made this because I can&#39;t eat gluten and really wanted to eat something that &#34;normal&#34; people can eat. It was so moist and good and tasted like &#34;normal&#34; banana bread and held up really well. I didn&#39;t use the nuts but I don&#39;t care for nuts but I&#39;m sure it would have been good with them. I let several people try it that can eat gluten and they said it was really good and didn&#39;t know it was gluten free until I told them. Will be making this recipe again.,2,2,positive

"Delicious!!  I used 9 medium/large potatoes, doubled the sauce/cheese ingredients and used a 9x13 baking dish.   I omitted the onion, not by choice, but because I simply forgot to put them in!  Still, these potatoes were wonderful.  I baked them about an hour and fifteen minutes, covered, and then continued to bake another thirty minutes, uncovered.  They came out perfect.  The potatoes were tender and covered in the cheesy sauce.  Perfect accompaniment to the glazed ham we had with it.  Will keep this recipe handy anytime I need a potato side dish!",2,2,positive
I&#39;ll never understand why people insist on changing things about the recipe then rating it especially giving it a bad rating.  You didn&#39;t technically make the recipe so don&#39;t rate it.   That being said this chili/soup is awesome just as it is.   I make it multiple times throughout the fall and winter.  I freese it in single.swvings in ziplocks and have a ready to heat and eat lunch.  The pumpkin gives it a richness without tasting pumpkiny.   Just the right amount of spice.,2,2,positive

"Super easy to make. Like others recommended, I used only one can of pie filling, flipped the proportions of vanilla and almond extracts and sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips. Could also do without the drizzle, or at least reduce it by half. Hubby thought the bottom cookie was too thick, but I liked it. Next time, I&#39;ll reduce the dough on the bottom and add it to the top. I also baked it for 35 minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for another 5 min with the door cracked. It was perfectly done. 60 portions seems optimistic, but even small, bite-sized squares hold up nicely as a finger food dessert.",2,2,positive

Used hashbrown potatoes, put half in at beginning and saved rest t heat thru at end so they held their shape, the early ones helped thicken the soup, added some frozen corn and made it like chowder, which my hubby loves. Use 1% milk. 2% mex. blend cheese.  required no flour. i used no velveeta. It&#39;s bad for u,  did use a bit of Hormel real bacon bits on top. It s so good.

Much quicker to put together. I did rim the slow cooker with aluminum foil to keep the edges from drying out as others suggested and it worked out fine.",2,2,positive
"This soup is awesome.  I cook for a large family so increased a couple of the ingredients. I saute&#39; the onion, celery, carrots and mushrooms in a little butter and add meat from a whole roasted chicken, chopped.  Also, increased the mushrooms and added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  This is a winner!",2,2,positive

I made this soup for dinner tonight and am very pleased at how it turned out! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except I didn’t thicken the soup with the flour mixture. I didn’t use it because then my gluten free son in law can also eat it. It was still a very nice consistency. I also used half velveeta cheese and half Cooper sharp just because I already had some to use up. I also doubled the meat. It is delicious!,2,2,positive

I used a smaller rectangle dish than a 9 x13. it was 8 x 11.5. So good! I froze the leftovers and even took a serving over to my neighbor who lives alone. She liked it too.",2,2,positive

"Very tasty!  Really - with bacon, cheese and sweet onions, how could it be bad????  I prepared it in reverse - starting with the bacon.  I chose to dice the bacon before cooking.  After removing the bacon I did the onions.  Be careful not to overdo the onions or you may end up with caramel onions that stick to your teeth.  (I may or may not have learned that the hard way!!) When the onions were done, I removed them to a separate bowl, wiped the skillet out and then cooked the chicken.  Once the chicken was done I piled the fixings up on top and let the cheese melt a bit.  We enjoyed it with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts.  Yum!",2,2,positive
"I will make into a cake next time,delicious..",1,2,positive
This is one of my husband&#39;s favorite meals and mine also because it is so easy to make! I leave out the cumin (because I do not care for the flavor) but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. We eat this for lunch and dinner multiple days in a row because it is so good!!,2,2,positive

"Excellent!!! I doubled the recipe to make a sheet cake and a couple of variations to lighten up (hopefully) the recipe. I subbed half of the eggs for whites, half oil for apple sauce, reduced sugar and added more apple sauce.  I didn&#39;t have orange juice so I added 1 Tablespoon of Lemon Juice per batch.  Kids loved it... that&#39;s all I need to know.",2,2,positive

"Fantastic and simple recipe! Loved it!  I added a few tablespoons of jam I needed to use up from the fridge, and I loved the added depth of flavor.",2,2,positive
First time I made this I had similar problems as others have had. Made it in 2 8&#34; round cake pans-I had a hard time getting it baked all the way -had to keep adding extra time. The icing was not as thick as I would&#39;ve liked but didn&#39;t want to make it too sweet by adding more powdered sugar. This time I baked in 3 8&#34; pans and bake time was 18 min at 350 degrees. Used the recommended 2 oz of cream cheese and drained the pureed strawberries for icing-PERFECTION! Either was the cake is absolutely delicious! Kept in the refrigerator as a cool dessert with this hot summer heat. This is will definitely be in my recipe book for life!,2,2,positive
"The flavor here is a nice mild heat tempered by the sour cream and heavy cream. If you do not like heat, omit the cayenne pepper. I made a savory cornbread to go with this (sans sugar), added cheese, garlic powder and onion powder. In place of buttermilk, I used powdered milk and a corn meal/flour premixed, and added a cup of cheese. Nice for a rainy autumn day. Enjoy!",2,2,positive
"I made this for the first time, yesterday, July 29, 2018. I DID NOT make the glaze, as others recommended. This is delicious! I will definitely make this again and again. :)",2,2,positive
"Great recipe, it was a hit at our Easter party.",2,2,positive
"Very tasty!  Instead of pounding the chicken breasts, which were large, I sliced them in half, which worked well.  I also used a heavy hand with the mushrooms, because I like them.",2,2,positive
"This was one of the first recipes I made when I began subscribing to the Taste of Home magazine in the 1990&#39;s.  I made the cupcakes for a outdoor concert I was going to on a summer evening. Delicious, moist spice cupcakes with a wonderful butterscotch icing. They were a big hit with my friends. Couldn&#39;t eat just one.",2,2,positive

These are really good.  I added a shake of cloves in it too.,2,2,positive
I have hard time calling this the &#34;best ever&#34;. It took 30 min longer than estimated to bake and the top was all crusty and dark because of the high amount of sugar. I also made a batch of the basic banana bread muffins and preferred that recipe a lot more.,1,2,positive
There isn&#39;t anything to change with this recipe. One of the best!  Thank you Brenda for sharing.,2,2,positive
Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and took for a large group campout.  Nice change from the normal macaroni or coleslaw.,2,2,positive

I love meatloaf but wanted to try a different recipe my husband and I love cheese so I decided to give this one a try. It is delicious but do agree there is a bit much brown sugar in it but that can be fixed. Thank you for the idea and love that they are mini so you can pack them in your lunch box for work and have a little hunk of meat to munch on. Will definitely be making this for years to come.,2,2,positive

"This recipe is amazing. I’ve been making it for years. Ignore the rude and ignorant comments from those who have yet to actually make it. If you want spicy feel free to add as much or as little of the cayenne pepper or jalapeños with or without seeds to your liking. That’s the beauty of cooking at home. One tip I will give, if you want an extra creamy texture, add the creams in right away and let simmer until reduced.",2,2,positive
made with meat tortelli 2nd time  and was very good as well/ instead of sausage,2,2,positive
"Great recipe--it does a wonderful job of &#34;disguising&#34; the healthy ingredients.  However, it has WAY too much sugar in it for me.  I doubled the recipe to make it the same as my regular pancake recipe--meaning it now calls for 2/3 cup sugar!  My normal pancake recipe only has 2 tablespoons of sugar for the same amount of flour/oats.  Because we use syrup on our pancakes I don&#39;t feel like I need my pancakes to be sweet too--its just added sugar that is unnecessary.  So, next time I will reduce the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a delicious recipe.   (also they brown quickly due to all the brown sugar in the recipe, just turn down the heat so they cook a little more slowly and you&#39;ll be fine)",2,2,positive
"Made it as written, turned out great.  Will make again",2,2,positive

"We don&#39;t have pancakes often but I made this recipe for a treat. They were really delicious. I only got six pancakes from the batter but that was plenty for us without batter to waste. I added blueberries to the last half of the batter for fun. When I make them again, I will probably add a little vanilla to amp up the flavor.",2,2,positive

It was a big hit with my family. I will make it again this year for my husbands and my anniversary. It is so good!! Lala from Nashville",2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made this twice now, and will be making it again and again!  I use soft corn tortillas for a more authentic enchilada flavor and double the cheese.  The contrast of the cool lettuce, tomato, and cilantro topping is fantastic.  Be sure to use a very sharp knife to cut the casserole, as the bottom layer of tortillas can be a bit of a challenge to cut neatly.",2,2,positive

"Made this yesterday. I used 24 oz. pasta sauce with basil instead of plain tomato sauce. I also added 1t oregano. Used non-boil lasagna. Assembled everything a day ahead and cooked it 50 minutes and refrigerated it (covered tightly). The next day, I warmed it 20 minutes at 250 and 10 minutes at 350 until the edges bubbled a bit. It was a huge hit. Next time I will use real mozzarella cheese and shred it myself, but this time I didn&#39;t have the energy for that. I think it will make it a 6 star if it has real cheese instead of the prepacked shredded cheese, which has fillers. This photo is a bit deceptive. My pan was filled to the top.",2,2,positive
"It’s a lazy Sunday between Christmas and New Year’s and I’m indulging in my favorite things: reading recipes, cooking, and reading my library book. This soup recipe called out to me as I have all ingredients and it is perfect for this cold day. I deviated just a bit by adding the flour to the vegetables as they were cooking in the butter. I also added a finely chopped stalk of celery because I needed to use it and thought it would enhance the soup. I used evaporated - again because that’s what I had available. I thought the soup needed a little something, so I added a sprinkling of thyme and poultry seasoning. I will make this again and again with this modifications. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up. I’m enjoying a mug of the creamy soup right now as I watch a movie. Lynne, TOH Volunteer Field Editor",2,2,positive

"I have never made white chili before and I was sceptical to try this! I am so glad I did! My entire family loved this! I cooked my chicken lightly in my skillet with onion/garlic, but then instead of cooking it all on the stove, I put it over into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients. I started this in the morning on high and it was ready in 4 hours. (I chose this method because I am a busy mom and I like to start my meals in the morning and then have all the prep work done for me) I served this up with some cajun bread and we had a wonderful lunch! Thank you for another wonderful recipe, Taste of Home! Will be making this one again!",2,2,positive

"Lasagna is not a dish that originated in Italy.  So this is American Lasagna and it&#39;s delicious - it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be.  Lasagna comes from the Greeks - I actually make a Greek lasagna better known as Pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef  but when I want American Lasagna I make this recipe.   Did you know the Brits actually found a recipe for Lasagna from the 1390&#39;s?  Each country has perfected their own claim to Lasagna fame.  When the Italians make it in Northern Italy they do not use ricotta cheese, they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella.  Ricotta is used in the Southern region only, this is why many Italians in America use ricotta - most are descendants from Southern Italians.  So even Mario or Giada is making it wrong if you are from Tuscany.",2,2,positive
"I make this often, wonderful flavor.  My 3 and 5 year old grandkids were over and couldn&#39;t get enough of it.",2,2,positive
"I had doubts that this was going to turn out because the sauce ended up very thick.  It was almost like a paste, and I wasn&#39;t even able to simmer it for the whole hour because I was afraid it was going to burn.  However, the lasagna still tasted excellent even with the very thick sauce.  I think the next time, I will maybe use a can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of sauce.  Also, I would wait to add the last layer of mozzarella cheese until after you uncover it, because most of the top layer of cheese ended up on the foil when I removed it.  I also used the no-cook noodles for this, and they came out great!",2,2,positive

"Made this last week, it was the best lasagna I have ever made!  So said hubby.  Only changes I made was to use Italian sausage instead of the pork, and no boil noodles.

"I hadn&#39;t thought about making banana bread before, but I have a large quantity of walnuts sent to me from my grandpa (who hand picked and shelled BUCKETS of them).  I was excited to try this recipe based on the many awesome reviews &amp; boy were they spot on!  I did chop the nuts pretty small, as I don&#39;t really care for giant nuts in bread.  Next time though I&#39;ll make an exception and leave them a bit bigger, by request of my dad who loves the walnuts and appreciates my grandpa&#39;s hard work! ;)  I did leave three muffins without nuts just to see the difference and enjoyed them both ways.  I followed a few suggestions from other bakers; I only put in a cup of sugar (3/4 regular and 1/4 brown), I put in three bananas and I added cinnamon (a lot because it&#39;s my favorite!) and I thought they came out great!  I made regular size muffins and would love to figure out how to make a topping for them (maybe granola or something else to add a crunch or caramelized texture), I&#39;m open to suggestions!",2,2,positive
This recipe is a sure winner! I&#39;ve used it over and over again. Always turns out moist and delicious! My family loves it.

I don&#39;t always put vegetables in it but it is delicious either way.

I always look it up before I buy the ingredients to make sure I don’t miss anything. I search by “white chicken chili cream cheese ” to make sure I pull up this recipe. I was surprised to see sour cream now, especially because they specifically mention cream cheese in the description. I will continue to make it with the cream cheese because this is a family favorite and I don’t want to change what’s not broken. I make this close to the post recipe, but I do slow cook it on the stove with boneless skinless chicken breast and I also add cilantro when I mix in the cream and cream cheese. My picky boys love it!",2,2,positive
I have made this recipe for years.  It&#39;s always a hit and one of my hubby&#39;s favorites.   I don&#39;t make it often enough for him!!  I do use a little less cream in my caramel mixture so it is not as runny.,2,2,positive

I&#39;d definitely do this recipe again and again.",2,2,positive

I used chicken stock instead of broth.....I think it gave more richness to the recipe.,2,2,positive
"OOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYY  Five stars are not enough to express how yummy this dish is!  This smelled heavenly, and tasted even better!  We had roast chicken on Sunday and I used the leftover meat and rich broth.  I cut the recipe in half, since I only made one pie.  I didn&#39;t have peas, so substituted cut fresh asparagus for the &#39;green.&#39;  I also added garlic and bay leaves to the roux (removed before pouring into pie shell).   It reminded me of one of those high end chicken pies from the freezer section, but with less calories.  Thanks for the recipe Karen... it will definitely be a regular on our table!",0,2,positive
I had all ingredients but used corn tortillas instead of flour.  It was delicious!  My husband LOVED it!  It had a southwest flavor and the black beans were the perfect addition.,0,2,positive

I&#39;m from the south and don&#39;t put any sugar in cornbread. So I made it without and it was really good. My mother always used some hot bacon grease in hers,2,2,positive

Super quick and easy.  Makes cole slaw interesting and zippy.  I did not have any sour cream and used just mayonnaise and it was still good,2,2,positive
"This was very good.  I omit the nuts, but it really had nice flavor.  I reduced the cook time by about 10 minutes, I did the toothpick test on my smaller loaf pan just in case, then decided to check the larger as well, they were both done.",2,2,positive

Love this recipe!!!! I added pecan instead of walnuts. Thought the pecans would give it a better flavor instead of walnuts. So good. :-),2,2,positive
"Made this for the first time, last night.  Read all the reviews first. However, followed the exact recipe,  Results:  Thinner than desired, but quickly fixed that with the great suggestion of 1 to 2 Tbls flour.  Served with Tortilla chips. Great flavor, big hit with the husband!  Will make again with rotisserie chicken and replace the whipping cream and sour cream with cream cheese.  Unless a thinner chili is preferred, use the flour as other reviews suggest.",2,2,positive
These are absolutely delicious..... Everyone loved them &amp; I would difinately make them again!!,2,2,positive
I have made this recipe a couple of times  this time I made it with bottled spagetti sauce and regular uncooked lazagna noodles. It was great my boyfriend loved it said it was almost as good as my scratch.,2,2,positive

"I made these muffins recently and they were easy and delicious I used half Splenda and half sugar as well as the &#34;lighten Up&#34; method of using unsweetened applesauce for the oil.

This is so delicious! It’s a perfect blend of sweet and tart! It was so easy to make and it was very light and moist. I did rolI the blueberries in flour and used 10-X sugar for the glaze. I served it with a scoop of lemon sherbet . What a great summer dessert!,2,2,positive
Made this for a church pot luck and brought home an empty dish.  I did use  hot sausage instead of bacon and liked the flavor it added.,2,2,positive

wonderfull taste and texture,2,2,positive
I just made this for the second time in a week. OMG it is great and EASY. I saw asparagus on sale and thought ??? Again OMG. I also made a double batch. My husband doesn’t eat mushrooms but my best friend does and we are glad not to share with more.,2,2,positive
I added some diced celery and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and substituted thyme for the sage (because I didn&#39;t have any sage).  It was very tasty and I will make it again.,2,2,positive

I&#39;ve been making this cake for 43 yrs from the old Grange cookbook.  It is the best chocolate cake ever!  It is so moist and also tastes great with peanut butter icing!  For those who do not like coffee....it does not have a coffee taste.,2,2,positive
This dessert was much better frozen!,2,2,positive
After I made this recipe I have&#39;nt even triedanother one. This is a keeper!,2,2,positive
"To make things easier, I melted the butter before whisking in the sugar, and I made them into bars using a 15x10x1 jelly roll pan, baking for about 18 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.  Let them cool completely before cutting/eating because they probably wouldn&#39;t have held together too well out of the oven.They were absolutely delicious!  The oats were a little crispy, and they were very tasty.  My husband is trying to keep them all for himself.  I usually wouldn&#39;t make a recipe using convenience items like vanilla pudding, but I happened to have some in bulk I needed to use up (1/2 cup= a package).",2,2,positive
too sweet for my taste and not as good as I thought they would be...very disapointed...will not make again,0,1,neutral
"Very tasty, versatile crust. Great way to use up the zucchini overload. Even those who don&#39;t care for zucchini will enjoy it. Have made it with a layer of ricotta, fresh tomatoes  and basil instead of the  the meat sauce for a vegetarian alternative.",2,2,positive
"Nice flavor and pretty presentation. I used a full-size cake mix in a 9 x 13 pan, which made for a very tall dessert.  I thought the flavor of the cream cheese/pudding mixture might be improved with just a little added sugar.",2,2,positive

"Winter comfort in a bowl!Loved this soup - better than a previous recipe I&#39;d tried, too. I didn&#39;t add the mushrooms, green pepper, or jalapenos, and did a bit less milk. At the end it seemed to need some herbs so I added a bit of dill and parsley - and then it was perfect!",2,2,positive
"They are good, but even though there is zucchini in there, it&#39;s got too much sugar, fat, and white flour in them to be thinkin&#39; the veggies in there will make them &#34;good for you&#34;. It is a good excuse to make cupcakes though, when you have alot of zucchini, lol.",0,2,positive
I made this tonight with leftover ham from Easter . My husband loved the sweetness of the corn and the saltiness of the ham. I cut this recipe in half and used skim milk. It turned out great. Goes well with homemade corn bread.,2,2,positive

The soup is supper easy. Our church does a fund raiser making soup and I have made this for the event and it was well received.,2,2,positive
I haven&#39;t actually put this recipe to the test yet because we just installed a different oven last night and i still need to clean it. but the main reason is that i have a special needs diet so i will have to substitute almost every ingredient in order to be able to eat it safely. I&#39;m not sure if anyone else out there is a vegan/diabetic with no immune system but if you are then you&#39;ve got a friend. The good news is that so far the things I have made substitutions for have been on me and my family so I will be happy to share the rating and the substitutions used if anyone is interested--or I could just write a book--- LOL,2,2,positive
"I&#39;m going to try it with nectarines.  It looks like a really great recipe.  I would like eventually to swap out the sugar for stevia, but not sure of the ratio.  Anyone help me?  How much stevia and what else do I need to add instead of sugar.",0,0,negative
This was a very flavorful chili.  I used ground turkey and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  It could easily be adapted to ground beef as well if that is your preference.  I would definitely make this chili again.,2,2,positive
"I didn&#39;t want to make a 3-layer cake, so I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9&#34; X 7&#34; Pyrex pan for about 25 minutes and it turned out perfectly. The cake is very good. The frosting was creamy and thick, but perhaps just a little bit too sweet.  But overall, a great-tasting cake!",2,2,positive

"When I was in middle school, I found this recipe and, subsequently, used to make it every year. When I found out I had a gluten allergy, I had to stop making them (they didn&#39;t have good gf flours then). However, this year when planning cookie gifts for Christmas, I remembered these cookies and found this online version of the recipe. I LOVE these cookies and so does anyone who I make them for! 
This time, to avoid my hands getting so sticky from shaping the balls, I took out about a tablespoon of dough and threw it into my sugar bowl and coated it with sugar and then shaped the ball. This really helped speed up the process and my hands didn&#39;t get so messy. 
Also, I recommend taking the cookies off of the pan almost immediately. With the last pan, I didn&#39;t do this immediately and the cookies collapsed slightly.",2,2,positive
"The potatoes were AMAZING, but the chops were a bit dry. Next time I may try adding a lemon or lime flavor to it to spice it up a bit.",2,2,positive
Yummy and easy. It was the perfect size to feed a large group. This will be served at our home!!,2,2,positive
"This is an AWESOME recipe, and I look forward to making it again. I did use regular mayonnaise, and red wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar. I also omitted the salt, it wans&#39;t missed. My husband liked the way it complimented the honey sauced chicken nuggets, and helped us get out of the winter doldrums. My daughter normally doesn&#39;t like the veggies listed, but with them being finely chopped in the food processor, she never even noticed them, and had 2 helpings! LOL! Plan on passing this recipe along to my sisters and also my best friend for her daughter&#39;s high school graduation party.",2,2,positive
This cake is Yummy with a capital Y. Try substituting a pineapple or coconut cake mix for the yellow cake mix. There are never any left overs.,2,2,positive
Question: does the pie separate into layers as it bakes? The. Pix shows a caramel layer on the bottom but the directions say put the cream cheese mixture in first.,0,0,negative
These are GREAT and very delicious! I used only 2 cups of sugar in the frosting and it was not too sweet but just right! I made thse for my husband&#39;s potluck for work and got an amazing 48 cupcakes from this recipe! awesome! I will make these again for Thanksgiving instead of my pumpkin roll!,2,2,positive
"This is an excellent recipe! Yes, it has less eggs than most breakfast casseroles, it is more of a hashbrown casserole than egg casserole and that&#39;s ok! I made this for my DIL&#39;s baby shower and got many compliments and requests for the recipe.",2,2,positive
I tried them for the first time for Easter.  They went over very well and were easy to make.  I  used 1 can pie filling mixed with frozen cherries picked last year to make up the difference for second can.  No extra sugar was needed and turned out great.  I did add 1/2 tsp. baking powder to dough.   Will be making again!,2,2,positive
Great recipe and my whole family loved it.,2,2,positive
"Delicious!  I didn&#39;t use my crockpot because it over cooks the chicken.  I browned the chicken in a little olive oil, then I drained the grease and cooked the chicken in the sauce until done.  Then I put the chicken on a plate and added the cornstarch/water mixture to the pan and heated until thick.  Then added the chicken back to the pan.  Chicken was tender and not over cooked.",2,2,positive
"I looked at the recipe and thought it would be good. It looked so easy. It was VERY easy and VERY good. I would serve this at a wedding or wedding like event. It  was great as leftovers as well.

"Yum!! Just made this soup using frozen hashbrowns and it turned out delicious! I used a little less bacon, around 3 cups or more frozen hashbrowns, and shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveta. I used fat-free milk and added a touch extra salt after tasting it when it was done. Didn&#39;t have fresh onions on hand, so used 2 Tbsp hydrated onion. This will be on my list of great soups for fall!",2,2,positive
"Bread turned out great, could I use honey to sweetin and result",2,2,positive
AMAZING!!!! My family loved it! I have forwarded this recipe on the about 10 other people as well! Definitely a keeper and will be making this alot! Thanks for sharing!,2,2,positive
"Four stars because I made so many substitutions, but this is an easy recipe that adapts well to different tastes. I went the savory route: used only 1 T. sugar, added 1/2 c. chopped onion and 1 chopped jalapeno, sprinkled cheddar cheese on top the last few minutes of baking. Wow - was it good!",2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve never made gf banana bread before, but I have made other gf goodies that do turn out pretty good, but notably different from their non-gf counterparts.  This banana bread was absolutely amazing and EASY!  It&#39;s just like regular banana bread &amp; I received multiple compliments on it.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!",2,2,positive
"This is wonderful!!! I did think it needed a little more flavor (I didn&#39;t add the pepper sauce), so I used 4 chicken bouillon cubes in the water. Perfect!!! I have made this twice, once with cauliflower and once with broccoli, and will make it again and again!!!",2,2,positive
"Made this recipe as a side for our BBQ. This was delicious, quick &amp; easy. My husband loved it!",2,2,positive

I omit the water chestnuts as they don&#39;t seem to offer much taste and there is plenty of crunch without them.  I also have begun substituting Marie&#39;s Cole Slaw Dressing (refrigeration section of grocery store) in that I believe it has just the right tang.  This has been a popular salad wherever I&#39;ve brought it.   Thank you, Sandra, for sharing a real winner!",2,2,positive
"Excellent bread! I have tried many, many recipes over the years(my family LOVES bananas); needless to say this is truly the &#34;Best.&#34;Made it in 3 mini-loaf pans(of course had to adjust time due to small size of pans), and added another banana. It was delicious and easy!",2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made this bread several times already! The first time was good, and has only gotten better each time! I concur with Ryan below about using bread flour (I used King Arthur), but I use my wife&#39;s beloved Kitchenaid stand mixer which more than meets and exceeds the challenge of kneading. I also divide the dough into thirds (and can even go for four small loaves), and it does keep for a few days, IF it lasts that long! :-D The final bread product, when made with bread flour, is a good crumb, nice chew and wonderfully crispy, yet soft, crust.A WONDERFUL beginner&#39;s recipe! I&#39;ll experiment with adding herbs and other flavors to this dough!",2,2,positive

The amt of thyme was fine; my husband loved it and had two helpings.  I didn&#39;t think it was too thick at all; it was perfect because you added a lot of liquid ingredients ( milk and chicken broth and butter)I didn&#39;t rate it a &#34;5&#34; only because the salt and pepper was way too much; definitely have to cut it in half. Otherwise it was excellent. Bon Appetit!!!!",2,2,positive

I am not a baker, so I steer clear of those recipes calling for cake flour and super careful measuring. The hot water part scared me a little but I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect. The amount of frosting is very generous, and my husband thought it was perfect even though it was a little too sweet for my taste. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing this, I can see why it won a prize!",2,2,positive

"This is absolutely delicious - I would give it a 50 star rating if I could. We made it exactly the way the recipe states, we figured if we liked it and we were going to make it again we would make a change then. However it is PERFECT exactly the way it is, we love it!!! I made a batch yesterday (already gone) so I&#39;m making another batch today. Anyone who said they didn&#39;t like it (which is maybe one or two) must have used different brands or something than what we did because this is seriously good.....I can&#39;t wait to have more today!!!",2,2,positive
This was wonderful! I served it up with some cajun bread and everyone loved it!,2,2,positive
I was a bit nervous to make this soup because of the simple ingredients and simplicity of making it.  I&#39;m sure glad it took the chance because my family and I loved it!.  Definitely a hit and will absolutely make this again.  If you&#39;re not sure about this soup...take that chance.  It will be worth it!,2,2,positive
WE LOVED THIS!!!!!!! Will definitely make again.My husband said it&#39;s better than spaghetti.  Used canned pizza sauce and Parmesan on top. Could use a little more zucchini. I think I need to start growing zucchini. LOL,2,2,positive

"I&#39;ve made this a few times, and I always add diced tomatoes, mushrooms, and garlic.  And, I substitute the ground beef with seasoned ground  turkey.

"Absolutely one of the best, lightest, tastiest white breads I have ever made (and there&#39;s been a few).  Thank you to Steve for the suggestion regarding flour, started out with 6 cups and added as needed/kneaded ended up with the whole 6 3/4 cups.  The only thing I did different was I used a couple of tips I had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work.  The first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave, starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110-115 deg f., then add yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar.  While mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f. then turn off and allow to cool slightly, then put the dough in there to raise (door closed). I use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans I covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking.  I haven&#39;t had an issue with dough rising since I started using this method, as long as yeast is before &#34;best by&#34; date.",2,2,positive

Followed the recipe exact. Refrigerated this overnight and when I cut in to it the next morning to serve with coffee it literally ran. The inside never set and it turned out soupy! Not at all what I had expected and I can tell you that it was a complete waste of ingredients. Threw it in the garbage and I will not waste the time or ingredients again. Especially with the cost of pecans.,0,0,negative

Everyone loved them and complemented on the spicy flavor and tasty cinnamon frosting.  I just spread the frosting on top.  It firms up after sitting for awhile!  So good.  I&#39;ll make them again and again.",2,2,positive
This recipe does not taste like it was quick and easy to make!  It is a wonderful tribute to real jambalaya!  Everyone in our family loved it and was a perfect way to celebrate Fat Tuesday.,2,0,negative
"Great basic recipe that is easily adaptable to one&#39;s specific tastes. Be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe, though. The citric acid will eventually &#34;cook&#34; the chicken (in fact, this is how ceviche is made). As for freezing the chicken--yes, it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken. However, if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken, the culprit is most likely a dull knife. Of course, many of us freeze chicken, but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat. Given a choice, I would always choose &#34;never been frozen&#34; chicken, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t freeze it just to make cutting it easier.",2,2,positive
"Absolutely delicious.  Such good flavor and the sauce was the greatest.  Nothing like that can enchilada sauce.  The only thing I will do different next time is double the sauce and add an additional 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Very, very good.  Really the person who said these were bland have no taste buds.  I substituted the stewed tomatoes for a can of Rotel like another reviewer did.  Excellent!",2,2,positive
"This was just the recipe I&#39;ve been looking for... for a long time. I used New York Sharp Cheddar for my shredded cheddar. The sauce seemed  a bit thick, so before baking I added more milk to it.... bringing the total amount of milk to 2 and 1/2 cups. I needed to bake it for 45 minutes to get it golden brown and bubbly.  This recipe is a real keeper !",2,2,positive

"These are good. Recipe produced a really stiff dough, for me anyway -- wish I&#39;d started stirring the dry ingredients earlier (stand mixer was not happy).  And, I&#39;m with those who suggested to flatten at least a bit (mine didn&#39;t flatten as they cooled).  My mom had a recipe, who knows where it came from, called Super Ginger Snaps.  A soft-type drop cookie but more strongly spiced.  Still my favorites!",2,2,positive
"Easy recipe, quick to prepare.  My 3 year old loves it! I made the following tweaks: used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned, added black olives, omitted the onion, &amp; served with a dollop of sour cream on top. This recipe is now requested a couple of times a month in my house! Great alternative to the basic taco.",2,2,positive
"My husband &#34;hates&#34; casseroles (or so he thinks), but I had to try this recipe because to me it sounded wonderful.  He absolutely loved it.  It&#39;s been less than a week and he&#39;s wanting to know when I&#39;m preparing it again!  My only differences from the recipe--I only keep whole grain tortillas on hand, but they worked great.  And I forgot to pick up fresh tomatoes, so topped it with salsa.  And for anyone considering leaving off the lettuce--DON&#39;T!  Some crisp shredded romaine topped it off perfectly!!  My husband ate 3 of the 8 servings that night at dinner.  Perfect recipe!!!",2,2,positive
use this recipe a lot for my daughter bake sales she had.every easy and moist bread.love it.,2,2,positive

This is by far one of the most delicious soups I have made.  I didn&#39;t have velvetta cheese so used cheese whiz.  The sour cream makes the soup. Adds a nice finish to the already great soup.  I will make this often.  More of a meal than just a soup.,2,2,positive

"Boy, I made this and it was an epic fail.  Not sure what went wrong.  With all the 5 star rating, I must have really done something wrong although I can not figure out what it was.  The pecans on top definitely burnt as was warned.  But also the sides and bottom really burnt yet there was a thick layer near the bottom that was soggy and unbaked. I must get a oven thermometer to check my temperatures.  What was edible was yummy.",1,2,positive
"This was a hit at my house and very easy to make.  I didn&#39;t have the wheat flour handy so I used more of the regular flour.  I see you are able to freeze and reheat. I was hoping to make the silver dollar version of this for a ladies brunch I&#39;m having.  To save time, was wondering if I can make them all the night before, cool and freeze them and then use the reheating instructions.  Would love to hear from someone who has tried to reheat and how they measured up.  :)",2,2,positive
Not sure what all the 5 star reviews are about. I was disappointed. My husband liked this because it was spicy. My kids and I did not. I had to make a second dinner for them after they begged not to eat it. It will give you lots of gas too!,1,1,neutral
"This is definitely a first place macaroon recipe.  It has the best color, taste, and consistency of all I have tried; including the one on the coconut bag.  One addition I make is to sub in a almond extract (just because I like that flavor); 3/4 vanilla extract and 1/4 almond extract.  It also works just fine to use cooking spray instead of Crisco to grease your cookie sheets.  I quadrupled the recipe and it made 65 macaroons - using a teaspoon measure to scoop each serving.   I live at high altitude in Denver and did not need to do any substitutions.",2,2,positive
"I LOVE this recipe! I have one exactly the same cut from TOH mag probably 15 years ago. I leave off the peppers &amp; I have made it with sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef &amp; used crushed tomatoes instead of the diced. I use a mixture of Cheddar &amp; Mozzarella. Awesome, serves well &amp; freezes well even in individual containers.",2,2,positive
These have a perfect spice blend. I never think ahead enough to marinate things.  So I just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables. Worked great!  I also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap. My husband loved these!,2,2,positive
This cake was simply delicious. Diabetics and dieters both loved it. I did not put the whipped topping on. I whipped the pudding and the cream cheese and put it on the cake and then the pineapple and nuts and cherries. Everyone said YUUUUUM!,2,2,positive
"Quick, easy and delicious just as recipe is written.  Fresh mushrooms and scallions are a must!",2,2,positive
"So pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It was better than I expected. I initially thought the ingredients did not allow for enough &#39;sauce&#39; but it is so flavorful and it was indeed enough. I did, however, deglaze the pan after cooking the pork with about 1/4 cup of chicken stock because the spices got concentrated on the bottom of the pan. That didn&#39;t create more &#39;sauce&#39; because it evaporated - just wanted to get the good bits off the bottom of the pan. But that  I used leftover pork roast (cubed up) instead of ground pork. I also used more liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce and added another tablespoon (it needed more of that ingredient in my mind). Next time I make it I will probably use 2 oz. of the noodles instead of 4 (just personal preference - I would like more cabbage ratio than noodle). I did add one egg towards the end and scrambled it in the pan - didn&#39;t need it necessarily but I liked the added richness it provided. I added some chopped cilantro on top as I served it. This is a keeper and for me that&#39;s a big deal. I rarely go by recipes but I followed this one to the &#34;T&#34; and it was great.",2,2,positive
"Made this last night after seeing the recipe.  Oh boy, was this ever good!  With six kids still at home and it pleased each one of them.  Two different things I did:  I did not add bacon (didn&#39;t have it), next, I used deli ham sliced into small pieces.  This is a keeper recipe!!!",2,2,positive

"These bars are SO good! I made some alterations and they still turned out great! (cut back on sugar, used 3/4 cup of vanilla yogurt &amp; 1/4 cup sour cream, 3 bananas, added walnuts.) I also halved the frosting and STILL thought it was a little too much (but soooo tasty)",2,2,positive

"Love this soup. I am teaching my son to cook and he said he wanted to make a chicken noodle soup.  I picked this for it&#39;s simplicity.  It was great!! Next time I will add some veggies, but this was a perfect soup to teach an eight year old to cook.",2,2,positive
First time I have written a review and I have tried ALOT of recipes for chocolate cake online. Husband is a chocoholic and complains I haven&#39;t made a really great chocolate cake..much to my bruised ego... but this recipe is fabulous made exactly as written here. Light and moist and looks great as well. Perfect chocolate flavor. Thanks Sandy!,2,2,positive
"You will never make another chicken pot pie after making this one! It is well worth the effort! If using frozen pie shells (like the tenderflake), I find I can get three pies out of this recipe! I also add chopped parsnips with the carrots and then cut down on the frozen veggies. The richness of the sauce is just incredible! Even my one year old eats an entire piece!!",2,2,positive

"Worth the work!I used homemade pumpkin puree (1 3/4 cup) instead of the canned pumpkin, made my own pumpkin pie spice, and used soured milk instead of the buttermilk.I think the recipe needed a little less liquid on the day I made it, but I went against my better judgement and used all the recipe called for. Thus, the cupcakes didn&#39;t set fast enough in the oven and had &#34;hat brims&#34; of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice dome.I also made half of the frosting (as suggested by previous reviewers) and it covered all 30 (not 24 as the recipe claims) cupcakes nicely. The frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for (what I think is) a lot of cinnamon.As to why frosting might not be setting up (as mentioned by Alie0717): If you make cream cheese frosting with low-fat (Neufchatel cheese) or fat-free cream cheese, it doesn&#39;t have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting. Soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only full-fat or regular cream cheese. Remember, the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting.",2,2,positive
I made a half batch of this last night and it was great!  I love a quick recipe that is still from-scratch!,2,2,positive
I make this several times in the fall and winter. Served with biscuits or cornbread it makes a hearty dinner on cold evenings,2,2,positive

I used a whole pound of ground turkey and 2 whole cans of chicken broth plus a half can of water. Otherwise I did the recipe as written and it was excellent!!!  Everyone liked it and it was very hearty. Will make it again.,2,2,positive
I decrease the amount of brown sugar in the topping and add a couple of broken up Butterfinger candy bars. It is a huge hit!,2,2,positive

I also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup per another reviewer.  And for the tomatos I used Hunts Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic &amp; Oregano.  Good flavor, will make agan.",2,2,positive
"This is, truly, a 5-star recipe!  The best lasagna that I have ever eaten!  The only tweak that I made was substituting seasoning salt for regular salt.  Besides that, I followed it to a &#34;T&#34; .  The whole family raved about it.  Thanks for another winner :)",2,2,positive
This recipe was extremely easy to make and very tasty.  I used a chocolate crust instead of a graham cracker crust.  I will make this again and try it with different gelatins and yogurts.  Strawberry sounds good with fresh strawberries layered in the bottom.,2,2,positive
Here&#39;s another one that I followed the directions right down to the letter. First of all it was to &#39;Eggy&#34; for me. So I&#39;d strongly suggest that you NOT use a dozen of eggs that this calls for! That&#39;s just WAY to much egg. The ladys at Church liked it but I can&#39;t believe this is a Grand prize winner. I won&#39;t be making this again. I was so disappointed! One lady at Church had to actually spit it out of her mouth. She said sorry but there&#39;s way to many textures going on with this. I did really like the homemade blueberry syrup however. I would rank the Syrup Only a 5 but not the casserole. I find it surprising that So many of ya&#39;ll like this so well.,1,1,neutral
It was a chilly September morning so baking was on my list ! The cookies are scrumptious but I didn’t feel they had enough ginger so I added about 1 1/2 -2 tsp of Ginger paste that was in my refrigerator ( Aldi find )  I also use thicker coarse colored sugars in a rusty red autumn color.  They have the coarse sugar at TJMax or Marshalls far cheaper than anyone. ! I took them out of my convection oven when they were soft and voila the center is soft and the outer edges are crispy!  My house is toasty warm with the taste of home so reminiscent of my youth when my Mama was baking up a storm.  ????,2,2,positive
I followed the recipe to a &#34;tee&#34;.  These cupcakes were delicious.  Texture was perfect.  Icing is wonderful.  Definitely a keeper!,2,2,positive

"This was SO delicious!  I used heavy cream because my hubby didn&#39;t realize it wasn&#39;t whipping cream, but it didn&#39;t make any difference. I definitely won&#39;t wait until the next holiday season to make this one! YUM!!!",2,2,positive

I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup I would not do that again.  It was not sweet enough.  I would also swape one cup flour for one cup cornmeal.,2,1,neutral
"Four stars for taste. One star deducted for the instruction to use an 8x4 pan. It was too small and batter bubbled over it. Also, the top browned quickly but that was mitigated by putting a piece of foil over top. Unfortunately the bread was still gooey underneath even after 70 minutes so I scooped it into plates and microwaved it to firm it up. My hubby isn’t a big sweets eater but he really, really liked this. I left out the nuts because I don’t like nuts in baked goods. Next time I make this I will only use a 9x5 pan and hope for better results.",2,2,positive

I added about a cup more chicken broth as well to compensate for the extra chicken.  I didn&#39;t have jalapenos so I added a  7oz can of diced jalapenos when I was cooking the chicken.  Terrific reheated as well.  We topped ours with Monterey Jack. This was a hit at our house on this cold snowy day.",2,2,positive

"This cake is delicious!  I&#39;ve made it twice now, and I definitely prefer using a Devil&#39;s food cake mix over a milk chocolate mix.  The chocolate flavor is more intense, which I prefer.  I&#39;m usually not a fan of buttercream frostings, but this one is pretty good, and I LOVE the ganache over the top.  It really balances out the sweetness of the chocolate buttercream.  I personally don&#39;t like really thick frosting on my cakes, and I felt there was too much buttercream.  The second time I made this cake, I only made half, and it was the perfect amount of frosting, in my opinion.  Very delicious cake!",2,2,positive

I&#39;d used a meatloaf pan to bake this meatloaf!</p><p>I would  probably omit the brown sugar in this sauce if I choose to use prepared BBQ sauce and I&#39;d probably omit the Worcestershire sauce since BBQ sauce has all the additions in it already!

Anyway, they turned out slightly dry so I will try removing them sooner next time.",2,1,neutral
This cake recipe is delicious. I did not use the frosting recipe because I made a ho ho cake and tried the cake because I didn’t have a chocolate cake mix.

"This is the BEST white chicken chili I have ever tasted.  Everyone loved it and I am asked to make it all the time.  I am confused, however, by the little note at the beginning of the recipe which reads &#34;Maybe it&#39;s the cream cheese&#34;.  Am I missing something?  I don&#39;t see cream cheese in the ingredients list anywhere.  Sounds like it would be good, though.  I highly recommend this chili!",2,2,positive

"I use Yukon gold potatoes, add white wine, butter and use big chunks of razor clams in this recipe. I also let it cook slowly for hours to let the potatoes cook down and the chowder turns a tan color. Every time  I make a double recipe of this it&#39;s usually gone that night. Fyi... If you let the potatoes cook down you won&#39;t need flour. I don&#39;t know about you but I prefer it that way instead of having a potato soup like chowder",2,2,positive

"I love twice baked potatoes so this casserole is definitely one I&#39;ll try. I know ahead of time that I won&#39;t use the amount of sour cream called for due to past experience of the overpowering taste when I&#39;ve made twice baked potatoes. My solution to that is to substitute French Onion chip dip for a portion of the sour cream. Not only does it eliminate the sour cream aftertaste but it adds a nice flavor to the potatoes! It&#39;s a simple, easy solution.",2,2,positive

"On Easter, I followed the recipe exactly* (except adding some cayenne pepper- a family must) and everyone, even my really picky son, loved it.  A perfect side dish for ham.  Very easy to make.  *Since the russet potato slices are thin, I didn&#39;t peel them- which added nutrition and flavor- and it wasn&#39;t noticeable.  The oven temp and cooking time were exactly right.  The potatoes were tender but not mushy.  Unanimous decision to make it an Easter tradition.  Thanks Taste of Home.  I&#39;ll check back with you again.",2,2,positive

I made this for a family get together and everyone loved it!!  Will definitely make again.,2,2,positive
"Just made this on the request of my son-in-law after I posted them on Facebook. They are very good. I used allspice instead of cloves because I didn&#39;t have cloves and they were rather pricey in the store. I also made 12 cupcakes and put the rest in a loaf pan because I only had one cupcake tin. The loaf was good, too, though a little small. I will definitely be making these as an alternative to cupcakes. Would be good for breakfast or a midday snack if you left the frosting off. The frosting was also very good and easy to make.",2,2,positive
Very good!! Easy recipe … first time followed exactly but I added flour to chicken and onion mixture to help thicken and did not add cream cheese.

Use beef froth rather than water and cube which is convenient. Very satisfying dinner. Thank you for teaching an old dog a few new tricks.,2,2,positive
"My family devoured this delicious dish. After reading the reviews I made sure to dry the zucchini well, and I jazzed up my sauce with some fresh herbs (basil, parsley and oregano) and garlic, and instead of ground beef I used hot and spicy breakfast sausage I had on hand. Can&#39;t wait to make it again with a layer of sauteed mushrooms! Thanks for this great recipe.",2,2,positive

Incredible!",2,2,positive
Easy recipe and very tasty. I will make it again.,2,2,positive
"I wasn&#39;t feeling well so I cut a lot of corners here and it still came out great (and my kids liked it too). I used canned everything-- potatoes, carrots, corn, peas-- and skipped the bacon and onion. And we were short on cheese so I used a half jar of cheese wiz. (Don&#39;t judge.) Very tasty  soup. Thanks for sharing this very adaptable recipe!",2,2,positive
"So good!  To eliminate the bread not releasing from the pan do this:  Cut waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan after you spray the pan bottom to hold the wax paper tightly.   Spray the paper after it is in the pan.  After baking, run a knife around the sides to release the bread.  Turn the pan upside down and the bread will slide out.Peal off the wax paper.  Do not spray the sides of the pan to allow the batter to rise and form a nice loaf.  I do this for all of my dessert breads.  I double this recipe and pour it into 3 -  8&#34;x 4&#34; pans and freeze 2 of the loaves.  If making a single recipe I use a 9&#34; x 5&#34; pan.  If doubling, I cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and I don&#39;t add nuts at all.  I brush the glaze over the sides and then drizzle the rest of the glaze over the top.  Wonderful recipe!",2,2,positive
This was very easy to make and tastes great!  Will definitely make this again!,2,2,positive
"This soup is awesome! Hot, hearty, and delicious, perfect for a cold winter night. I cooked up some chicken thighs and used quick-make wild rice to make the process a little faster. I doubled the spices (garlic powder, thyme, and parsley) since 1/4 a teaspoon of each didn&#39;t seem like much and used wine (I&#39;d recommend using it instead of extra broth!) Also added a dollop of sour cream when I served it, made it even more creamy and yummy. Really tasty, highly recommend.",2,2,positive

Love it! Added a can of diced tomato and 2 packets of taco seasoning mix!,2,2,positive
Super simple and delicious. I followed the recipe/directions to a “T” and they turned out perfectly. You literally drop a spoonful of the batter to make a cookie. There is no secret method to doing this. They are not as crisp on the top the following day (after being stored in air tight container) but are still absolutely delicious.   Make sure your eggs are room temp!,2,2,positive
The flavor of this is incredible for such few and simple ingredients. I will make this many times. I used fresh basil and my local grocery only had sweet italian turkey so I was sure to give it a few shakes of red pepper flakes. The only thing I changed was I omitted the water. We like ours a little thicker and I like to avoid the carbs in the crackers that I typically use for that purpose. Two thumbs up. Oh and my eight yr old ate 3 bowls so your kids will like it too. :),2,2,positive
"For some reason i thought it said 3 cups flour. I was wondering why i had to double that. Aside from me reading directions wrong, its a fantasic basic recipe. I would say add a tiny bit of spice to the water before mixing.  I added a pinch of garlic salt, onion powder, and italian season and just wow! Such a small amount of spice can go a very long ways!",1,2,positive

"I thought the soup was delicious! I don&#39;t usually make a cream based soup for chicken noodle but the sour cream was a great addition! I also thought 6 1/2 cups of noodles were too many. I used a full four cups and it was still a lot of noodles. I only added one can of soup just didn&#39;t think it needed two. Sprinkled a little more bouillon in it, added three carrots, a couple of stalks of celery, and about a cup of chopped kale for color and because I have lots in my garden! I also just cooked my cubed  chicken and vegetables in the broth a few minutes before I added the noodles.",2,2,positive
Beyond delicious!  This is our new favorite dessert.  I added a  1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the apple mixture as we love the taste of apples and cinnamon.  Will return to this recipe often!,2,2,positive

The flavor reminded me of a french dip, I plan to shred the second roast, make some tasty homemade bread, add some swiss cheese, and use the remaining broth as french dip.  Or, perhaps do an open faced sandwich.  Yum.",2,2,positive
"Excellent dessert. I actually had someone who doesn&#39;t like sweets say that he loved this recipe because of the peanut butter taste. It is really sweet, but that&#39;s the point! Anything that puts chocolate and peanut butter together is going to taste great! I used low-fat, no-fat items where I could, but no one would know.",2,2,positive

"Works great, even with the quarter cup of oil I had to substitute for an egg because I only had one egg left. Also added half teaspoon of salt and baked just a bit longer than the recommend cooking time because I like mine a bit more firm. All told, I think this is a pretty foolproof recipe.

"Let me start by saying, I NEVER review recipes that I try.  This one, I had to.  I found this recipe about 4 months ago and made it, not holding out much hope that my kids would like it..they never like homemade mac and cheese.  The family devoured this casserole. Then I lost the recipe and couldnt find it until yesterday, they devoured it again! Some changes did have to be made.1. I used a whole box of bow ties and needed a little bit more, it was very saucy.  I like it like that so it didnt bother me.2. Yes, the sauce does get a little too thick, i just slowly added chicken broth to get to a good consistency for us.3.  GRATE your own cheese! It makes a world of difference in that grainy taste, plus its cheaper.I can finally stop looking for a mac and cheese recipe, this will be the only one i ever make again.

I only used about 1/4 cup of sugar to the topping, and both pkgs of cream cheese; the not so sweet topping offset the sweet center.  Plan to use this with straight strawberries, then blackcaps, and follow it up in late summer with peaches--I think they will all be awesome!!!  New keeper recipe!!!!",2,2,positive
I love this recipe because we all have most of the ingredients or substitutions at home.   I used a coconut flour (Mama&#39;s Coconut blend gluten free flour found at tj maxx) so to complement this I used coconut oil and a few flakes of unsweetened coconut on top with pecans. I had a guest staying at my house that was gluten free but all the other guests said they couldn&#39;t tell the difference and gobbled up the bread then asked to take the muffens home!  I made one loaf and 8 muffins with this recipe.  Fabulous!,2,2,positive
"Even better than I expected.  Not heavy.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of mushrooms (don&#39;t like &#39;em).  I&#39;m glad I made the whole recipe so we will get several meals throughout the fall.  Thanks, Taste of Home. I don&#39;t give many recipes 5 stars.",2,2,positive

"Super easy and made it Sunday for the week. Added a bit of garlic power to the mix and baled the chicken in packets with olive oil, salt and pepper along with a bit of chopped garlic...yum! Loving it now!",2,2,positive
"This is a new favorite in my house.  It&#39;s so quick and easy, but tastes like it took all day.    I modified the recipe a bit - I bake, then shred the chicken.  I also leave out the onions (I hate the texture, but like the taste so I use onion powder).  I also hate the texture of green chiles, so I puree them in the food processor.",2,2,positive
"for susie77....i have never like cottage cheese either, but my sister in law made us lasagna one time with cottage cheese instead of ricotta and i loved it!!!  been making my lasanga that way ever since!!!  i ususally make this recipe in the oven, but i think next time i will try it in the slow cooker.",2,0,negative
I used the entire amt of potatoes but cut everything else in half.  It worked out great!  I also used a 7x11 pan.  Definite hit!,2,2,positive
I love this soup and I am not a soup person. Only thing is I cut it in half since 14 servings is just too much for my family.,2,2,positive
"Not sure if anyone else commented on this but the meat mixture makes an AWESOME CHIP DIP!  This is our second time having this.  I made it with 1.5lbs of ground beef, skipped the onion b/c we use chunky salsa, added half a bag of sweet corn (for crunch), mixed in the sour cream and used a whole pkg of taco seasoning.  I was so hungry that I had a taste on a tortilla chip and we actually ate it like that for dinner!  Put some in a bowl, topped with shredded cheese and voila!  As my 4yo says, &#34;!Delicioso!&#34;  ",0,2,positive

"Being a New Englander I have had some of the best restaurant Shrimp Scampi ..  This recipe is by far the best I&#39;ve EVER had. 5 star restaurant,  wonderful.  Thank you",2,2,positive
Very good! I followed the recipe as written. The crust could have baked about 3-4 minutes longer but that may have been my oven. I took this to a potluck without having made the recipe before; that&#39;s always a gamble! I received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe. Tell-tale vote was in the fact that I took home an empty pan! The bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting. I also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used. It gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would.,2,2,positive
"I love this recipe!! I have tweaked the recipe a little I dont add the ranch dressing mix, and I do it without beans taste good on corn chips or tortilla chips, I had some on elbow macaroni and it was good!! My husband loves it too!!",2,2,positive
This recipe is a family favorite (since it appeared in the Taste of Home magazine back in the 90s) and my go to casserole for potluck dinners.  Many request the recipe.  Easy to prepare as you probably have all the ingredients on hand.  Thanks Ruth Koberna for this delicious recipe!,2,2,positive
"Excellent recipe and easy to put together. Like others, I used Italian sausage instead of beef (taste preference), otherwise made as is. Thank you!",2,2,positive
Fantastic. I didn&#39;t shred my carrots and I added a few extra. I got rave reviews at home.,2,2,positive

"This recipe is amazing and worth 5 stars. It is very close to a secret family recipe I have used for more than 50 years. Yes, you can use no boil noodles...if you must, but don’t give this recipe a low rating if you do and find it didn’t quite meet your expectations. Make the recipe using the ingredients as written. You won’t be sorry.",2,2,positive

"I made this recipe and everyone raved over it!! It was absolutely delicious. Everyone wanted recipe. That&#39;s how you really know if they like it or are just being nice. My daughter in-law loved it and she hates soup!  I, however,  went with the original version and used spicy italian sausage rather than turkey sausage  or ground  turkey, but I&#39;m sure they would also be fine.",2,2,positive
"This was sooo good! I made it using frozen shrimp and scallops, both defrosted. Wonderful taste. Rich and creamy. Will definitely make it again.",2,2,positive

"So simple and so delicious.   I didn&#39;t have green peppers, so I used tomatoes and green chiles.    After baking, I added sour cream, lettuce, and taco sauce.    The next time I make it, I will probably add more cheese, a little more taco seasoning, and corn.    Very good!",2,2,positive

"This is an AMAZING PIE. I actually didn’t look at reviews before baking and actually kinda shocked to see them lol. I did follow the recipe to a t. Yes, I will admit the pie is a bit liquidy AT FIRST BUT after a half hour there was no more liquid pouring out.  Taste wise, it’s amazing you can taste everything perfectly. Maybe a little to much cinnamon, but thats preference.  baking wise, it did take a little bit longer than said but if you just keep your eye on it and put foil around places that are getting to brown it’ll come out beautifully.  Either way would bake again, saving the recipe",2,2,positive
I&#39;ve made this recipe for years! Great stuff. Also make a great pasta sauce if made a little thicker! Adjust spices to suit your taste on any given day.,2,2,positive

These turned out tasty. I used butter instead of shortening and changed to gluten free all-purpose flour. I also added vanilla extract and used additional milk. I am looking forward to trying different variations on these like adding fruit!,2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made this twice so far. It will be my go-to pumpkin bread recipe.  It&#39;s a very adaptable recipe and I&#39;ll probably make it a little different each time. I&#39;ll never use 1.5C of sugar, that&#39;s for sure. Today I used 3/4th cup and it&#39;s perfectly sweet.",2,2,positive
This was awesome.  Only substituted mozzarella for the Swiss because we don&#39;t really like Swiss.,2,2,positive
"I prepared this for a party of 50 yesterday following instructions exactly with the exception of the &#34;low fat&#34; 1/2 n 1/2. I used regular and cut out 1/5 of the recommendation. It turned out to be an ABSOLUTE CROWD PLEASER! I received favorable remarks all afternoon and was asked by several to add it to my menu. I doubt that I&#39;ll add it to the cafe&#39;s menu, but I will DEFINITELY offer it on the catering, There is no doubt about this recipe winning contests. Thank you for sharing it",2,2,positive
"Very good pancakes.  Added about 2 Tablespoons of milk a little at a time.  Slightly chewy because of the oatmeal, but tasty and sweet.  Needed very little syrup on top.  Pancakes we&#39;re light but very filling.  Will  process the oatmeal next time to see if I like them better.  Will also add some vanilla next time for added flavor.  Added blueberries to the mixture.  Also used white wheat flour as that is what I had.  Will use this recipe again.",2,2,positive
I love this recipe!  I make it at least every other week. Simple and tastes great.  Wonderful use of garden tomatoes!,0,2,positive
"Great soup recipe, just the right amount of creaminess. I halved the recipe and used only 3 cups of chicken broth (the original would have called for 4 cups.) I did not have mushrooms on hand so I had to leave them out, as well as the chicken bouillon because I never use that. I loved the seasonings involved in this recipe, very yummy! I also left out the soup and just started the soup out with the original white sauce amounts called for in the recipe to compensate for no soup. ( I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1 cup milk, some chicken broth and a splash of vinegar.) Instead of precooking my rice I just added in 1/3 cup uncooked rice in the soup and cooked it until done. To add some more substance I threw in about 1/2 cup or so uncooked egg noodles. Very yummy and great topped with Parmesan cheese! Quick and easy and a nice change from traditional chicken noodle soup; will make again.",2,2,positive
"I made this with the veggies from my garden. It was so tasty that I will definitely make it again. I found that it did not feed eight, unless you have several sides or a giant salad. The reason I like casseroles so much is so I don&#39;t have to make sides ;-).  I feel to have it as a stand alone meal, that the more appropriate servings listed would be 5 or 6. Next time I make it (which i will for sure), I will double the recipe if I intend to feed more than 4.  Loved it!",2,2,positive

I&#39;m Diabetic so I replaced the sugar with Splenda.  I also have changed the 2/3 Cups Sugar to 1/3 Splenda Brown Sugar and 1/3 regular Splenda.  The Brown Sugar added a really good flavor to the filling.  My husband LOVED it.  I will continue to make this often.,2,2,positive
"I made this for dinner tonight, but cut it down to 2 pork chops for the two of us.  I made it per the recipe, except for the addition of poultry seasoning sprinkled on the chops (I like this on chops) and the potatoes (I thought they could probably use more than just salt and pepper).  I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and onions very thin. The potatoes were delicious, but after 25 minutes the 1/2 inch thick pork chops were dry and way overdone.  I could not see baking this for the recommended hour and a half since the chops are browned, which par-cooks them. I would recommend checking for doneness early.  I did have my doubts about &#34;scalloped&#34; potatoes with chicken broth, but they were so good I would make them on their own next time.",2,1,neutral
"This chicken turned out very flavorful and moist.  I left out the mushrooms and added onions and Italian herbs, as I did not have any mushrooms.  It is a great gourmet-style recipe that is not too complicated! I would definitely make this again!",2,2,positive
This is one of our favorite cakes to make! Perfect strawberry cake!,2,2,positive
Everyone loved this. I love how quick it was to make. So easy if you use the prepackaged containers of mashed potatoes. I used canned veggies and one beef bouillon cube. The sour cream was a nice touch.,2,2,positive

These were super easy to make however and I followed the recipe exactly using the pan size recommended.  Mine were ready to come out of the oven at 21 minutes at 350.  I am glad I checked the time - my sister makes this recipe often and it is now one of my favorites also!  Thank you!,2,2,positive

"When I first discovered this recipe in your magazine years ago, I gave it a try because it sounded so easy... and it was!  It was exactly like the peanut butter fudge they used to serve in the school kitchen when I was little.  Soooooo good!  At Debbie on Nov 3, 2018... The butter is used to grease the pan in step 1.  At Susan11160 on Apr 24, 2018... Maybe you should give the recipe a try before giving it such a poor rating.  The marshmallow fluff gives the fudge a soft, slightly fluffy texture and is not at all gross.  I&#39;m not fond of thick, dense, hard fudge.  This definitely is NOT thick and dense or hard... it&#39;s nice and soft and fluffy.",2,2,positive
"Very good and SO easy! It did need some salt I thought- I added about 1/2 teaspoon or so. I made a few alternations as well. Instead of canned chicken broth- my Mom makes and freezes it. I put in about 4 cups of broth. I also added one less cup of chicken. Instead of using 1 2/3 cups biscuit  mix, I used 2 cups using my Mom&#39;s homemade biscuit recipe. This is what I used:2 cups flour, 1 T. baking powder, 1/2 t. salt, 2 T. lard. Mix all ingredients together then add your milk, you may need to add about a tablespoon or so more mix. So easy and quick. It tastes a lot like stuffing..........",2,2,positive

My only suggestion:  DO NOT read the nutrition facts... just enjoy the cake!  I definitely will make this elegant cake again!",2,2,positive

"Excellent - I took the advice of a previous review and added 1 TBSP of flour to the chicken onion garlic mix. I used two Jalapenos instead of the canned chilies. I had to puree the beans only because my DH doesn&#39;t like the bean texture and I used butter beans.  Lastly, I used 4 oz of cream cheese I had left in the fridge and a splash of heavy cream.  EXCELLENT.",2,2,positive
I get requests for this once a week.  I use boneless and skinless thighs and have to cook about 6 pounds at a time.  If you bake the chicken then drain 1/2 the juice/broth for best results,0,2,positive
Very good.  The only thing I would do differently would be to add a 3rd can of beans.,2,2,positive
"the finish product was delicious, but I only used half of the packages. I served it with mashed potatoes and corn fritters...",2,2,positive
This was amazing! Draining the water out of the zucchini was more time consuming.. plan for atleast 15 minutes. I added fresh basil on top. All 3 kids and my husband LOVED it!,2,2,positive
Wonderful! I made this for a &#34;Chili/Stew&#34; night dinner at our church and everyone wanted the recipe.  We make it quite often at home and it&#39;s always a hit. I also use a freshly made rotisserie chicken which adds to the flavor.,0,2,positive

They absorbed the marinade and were incredible.  These marinated strips are great by themselves and could be used on salads, in a pasta etc. I&#39;ll use this marinade with smoked chicken breasts by themselves now. So delicious. Fajitas were great too.",0,2,positive

I just made these during the pandemic.  I have a bowl of very ripe bananas.  I&#39;m going to cut into 1/4&#39;s and freeze for smoothies.  I hate to bake and most of my stuff turns out or not very well.  This was an easy recipe that didn&#39;t take a lot of ingredients or brain power.  They turned out exceptionally well for us.  I&#39;m definitely saving and will make again with ripe bananas!,2,2,positive
"Absolutely amazing! My family and especially my in-laws scarfed this down. Mind you, my in-laws are 86 and 90 years old. I&#39;ve made a Mexican variation of this recipe. I sub&#39;d diced green chiles for olives and mushrooms, cream of chicken for cream of mushroom, taco seasoning for oregano, and mozzarella for parmesan cheese. I cooked the pasta al dente in water with 4 tbsp low sodium chicken boullion, 2 tbsp onion powder, a pinch of kosher salt (never table salt for cooking), and 1 tbsp olive oil. I used 1/2 can of the noodle broth to dilute the cream of chicken soup. (The hot water helped blend the soup quickly and evenly...plus the water was already flavored.)

I use various Jello flavors. It is especially good with strawberry Jello and 1cup frozen sliced strawberries mixed in the filling. I also use the larger 9oz graham cracker crust to fit it all in.

These meatballs are wonderful! Very easy to prepare too.  I served them with another TOH recipe for Baked Mashed Potatoes.  Great meal!,0,2,positive
"Since making this cake last year for St. Patrick&#39;s day it has become my &#34;signature&#34; cake.  People love it, it&#39;s easy and always turns out well.  I&#39;ve taken to mixing Bailey&#39;s in the frosting, instead of 1/2 cup whipping cream I do a 1/4 of each.  I&#39;m making it again tomorrow for my mom&#39;s boss birthday, sans Bailey&#39;s since it will be enjoyed at school.",2,2,positive
I have never cooked jambalaya before but I think this may be the best tasting jambalaya I have ever experienced. I cooked it in low heat on the stovetop used orange bell peppers and previously baked chicken. I used original Conecuh hickory smoked sausage( an Alabama favorite). I will make it again,2,2,positive
Would make a good grilled chicken sandwich (use breast vs thighs) with grilled pineapple ring and extra sauce.,2,2,positive

"I made this last night with mahi mahi, and it was great!  I&#39;ll try it again with tilapia, which I&#39;m sure will be great, also.  I imagine this preparation would be good for any kind of fish fillets.",2,2,positive
Very easy and satisfying.,2,2,positive
"Really, truly delicious!I wanted to make banana bread for my house full of people at Christmas time, but I had misplaced my grandmother&#39;s tried and true recipe when we moved last summer.  So I came to tasteofhome.com for a banana bread recipe to follow in a pinch.  It was a hit!I especially love the fact that this recipe is made with vegetable oil rather than shortening (like grandma&#39;s recipe was), so I was able to avoid using the hydrogenated oils found in shortening.  And I didn&#39;t have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted an equal amount of milk with 1 T. white vinegar added, and it still came out perfect.Best banana bread I&#39;ve ever made. :)",2,2,positive
I tried this from googling peanut butter fudge. It was easy. Creamy and taste heavenly.,2,2,positive
These are awesome!!,2,2,positive
"This was so easy to make and so delicious!! I added the whole package of mushrooms instead of just one cup, and I did 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup white wine... I HIGHLY recommend this!",2,2,positive
This is my favorite banana muffin recipe because I don&#39;t have to deal with shortening or butter!  I do add about 1 T of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and accidentally added a second egg --- the muffins were super moist.  I only needed about 17 minutes of baking and they were pretty dark on the outside (still looked good but not that golden color).  That could just mean my oven isn&#39;t accurate (entirely possible).,2,2,positive
"Has a really good taste. I did change it a bit by putting the refried beans in with the meat mixture, just much easier. Also added lettuce, tomatoes, taco sauce &amp; sour cream on top. Will put in my keeper list.",2,2,positive

So easy and delicious!  My kids ADORED this meal!,2,2,positive
"I found this recipe to be lacking something, so I threw in a few extra things and it turned out pretty well. I used only 1/4 tsp oregano, instead of 4 garlic cloves I used garlic powder, I also added a handful of spinach, and some wild rice. I added a little of a seasoning blend, and added fresh ground pepper.",2,1,neutral
I wasn&#39;t paying attention and did not have any heavy cream. And thought the cream was suppose to be in the bars. I used vanilla greek yogurt in the filling and about 8 ounces of Cool Whip in the frosting. These bars turned out excellent.,2,2,positive
Good like it is. I&#39;m leaving this one alone!,2,2,positive
HAVEN&#39;T MADE I YETBUT IT LOOKS GOOD,2,0,negative
This soup is outstanding.  I will make it over and over again...My husband says it is one of the best soups he has eaten. I used one box of Uncle Ben&#39;s White and Wild Rice (original recipe) for the rice in this recipe.  The only thing I did different was add 1/2 stick of butter at the end and I simmered the chicken along with the vegetables...It was wonderful and I can&#39;t wait to make it for company...,2,2,positive
"Absolutely delicious!  Perfect for a potluck.  I do think it would be great with tuna,chicken, etc.  Will definitely be making again.",2,2,positive
"Incredible - such a homemade taste! The spices were perfect, nice creamy tasty sauce and the amounts were great for our taste - enough sauce but not swimming in it. I did spread the sauce all over the top of the rolled tortillas once they were in the pan, as another reviewer said - and it really kept them from being too dry and crunchy. I made the whole recipe, then split it into two 9-inch glass dishes - two whole dinners for my husband and me!",2,2,positive
"Very easy, quick, and delicious. I will make this again.",2,2,positive
"Best bananna bread ever! I had never made gluten free anything, and this turned out so well!  I did make a couple of changes so that didn&#39;t have to use sugar:-I omitted the sugar-I added a generous half cup honey-I added an extra quarter cup GF flour-I added an extra half teaspoon baking soda-I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon salt-I baked it for 40 mins (apparently honey can make stuff burn)- I could have even baked it for 35 mins.It was fantastic!  I am sure the recipe would be great as is, if you don&#39;t do the honey switch. (The honey was plenty sweet btw!)",2,2,positive
"This was SO delicious! I ended up having leftover frozen ravioli so I followed the recipe and reduced the amounts. I fit it into one of my special pots that is oven-safe, and my husband loved it! I&#39;d forgotten to cover it before baking, and he was thrilled with the results: nice &#39;n&#39; brown cheese on top!",2,2,positive
"This recipe looks delicious, however,  enchiladas are not made with flour tortillas.  They are made with corn tortillas here in Colorado.  To me, flour tortillas just turn to mush if baked in a sauce.  But the recipe looks very good. will try it with corn tortillas, fried or heated in oil first.",0,1,neutral
The brown sugar needs to be mixed into the salad and there should be more of it. 2.3 stars,1,2,positive
"Never made a decent meatloaf, which family didn’t care for anyway. Found this recipe in Taste of Home’s Copycat Favorites book.  BINGO! Didn’t change a thing and has now become a favorite.  I am feeling ‘victorian’ !",2,0,negative
Easy to make cheesecake that everyone loves!,2,2,positive
I used this recipe exactly as is and we loved this side dish for the 4th of July Stay-at-Home celebration. I bought pre-packaged cabbage/carrot mix but this homemade coleslaw dressing really put it over the top. I will definitely make this a summer family staple dish.,2,2,positive
My family loves this recipe. I use ground turkey and add the sour cream to the mixture. I also add a can a corn.   5 stars!!,2,2,positive
"Delicious!  I only used 6 slices of bacon, and not all of the sour cream cheese mixture, but it was fantastic and my guests all asked for the recipe.",2,2,positive
"OMg, I just made this for our &#34;First Night of Patriots Football Celebration&#34; and it is to DIE for!!! I can&#39;t wait to share it with our guests...that is IF there&#39;s any left by the time they get here!!! :)",2,2,positive
I already reviewed this and not sure why it didn&#39;t post?  I&#39;ve made this cake 3 times to rave reviews.  There seems to be some question about the amount of butter in the frosting. It is correct.  The flavor is chocolatey and butter and the consistency is soft but oh so good!,2,2,positive
"I&#39;m not a big meat-eater, but this roast was fabulous! I used a three pound roast and threw in carrots, celery, potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. The roast was extremely tender and juicy. I can&#39;t wait to make it again.",2,2,positive
Awesome,2,2,positive
"Absolutely Outstanding!  Will make this over and over. Made a few changes due to personal preference or because what I had on hand. Used reg. Hickory Smoked Bacon. Used a Vadalia onion, added 2 carrots, sliced, used black pepper, added 1 Knorr homestyle chicken concentrate and reduced chicken bouillon to 1 tsp, probably would omit bouillon all together next time. Used 4 cans of Snow&#39;s minced clams, drained and used juice in place of bottled clam juice.  Sauted carrots with onion and celery.  Gave a bowl to my next door neighbors and 5 mins later they called and said this was &#34;Fine Dining, Restraunt Quality&#34;.",2,2,positive
Sometimes coleslaw is too sweet and sometimes it&#39;s too tart.  This is a good balance.  I used celery seeds instead of the celery salt because I like them. A keeper.,2,0,negative
"Excellent &amp; fast!  After reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce ingredients.  I didn&#39;t have the Chinese 5-spice powder, so substituted Chinese cinnamon.  Also, we don&#39;t care for the dark meat of poultry, so I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  It was wonderful.  The only suggestion my family made was to cube the chicken.  I served it with wide rice noodles.  Delicious!",2,2,positive
"I thought this was delicious, and my whole family agreed!! I did read the comments before making it, and saw that one suggested using more taco seasoning which I did, and was thrilled with the outcome. I left out the Italian dressing and cilantro, and we were out of tomatoes and lettuce so I did tweak it quite a bit but it ended up amazing. We will definitely be making this again!!",2,2,positive
I made this for my husband tonight.  He was speechless and let me say THAT doesn&#39;t happen very often.  Tasted great.  Will definitely  make again.  Will love the leftovers it gave us.,2,2,positive
"I have always loved white chicken chili but this was my first try at making it.  It is a small recipe that really serves 3 large servings instead of 6.  I made the following changes to just about double it.  I used 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 tsp of salt, 1 tbls pepper, 1 med. onion, 1 small can mild green chilis, 3 tsps dried oregano, 2 tsps ground cumin, 4 cans white kidney beans, 4 cups of chicken broth, 3/4 cup shredded cheddar and 3/4 cup shredded pepper jack.  Everything else in the recipe I left the same.  Cilantro is super important in this recipe as it pulls all the flavors together.  If you try it without, I think it&#39;s kind of bland.  Love, love, love this stuff!",2,2,positive
Just came out of the oven and we have eaten half of the first loaf.  It&#39;s delicious.,2,2,positive
"My husband, who doesn&#39;t like cauliflower, loved this recipe.  It is delicious!",2,2,positive
"I love the people here!  We don&#39;t worry about carbs, fats, etc.  We seem to be home cooks with a family to feed &amp; please!  Common sense suggestions to make this more flavorful, &amp; realistic serving amounts.  I really love you guys because we do home cooking, not the modern-day, always healthy stuff that our families don&#39;t enjoy!  I&#39;ve made this salad since it was in TOH in 2002, &amp; it&#39;s been a favorite with our family of eight, now up to 13!  I, too, add 8oz. of sharp cheddar cheese &amp; any garden produce we have on hand.  It changes a little every time I make it, &amp; they always enjoy it!",2,2,positive
"This got my husbands 2 thumbs up...had it today for lunch.  I did add 1tsp each, basil, oregano and garlic powder to sauce along with fresh mushrooms on top. Definitely a keeper!",2,2,positive
This was really yummy!  I didn&#39;t have walnuts so instead I chopped up some almonds that I had on hand.  My husband loved it!,2,2,positive

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Will be making for Christmas.,2,2,positive
Made this with Tinkyada GF noodles very good,2,2,positive
I’ve made this chili for several years and follow the recipe as written. I use chicken tenderloins and heavy cream and sour cream.  “If it’s not broken don’t fix it”.  It’s the perfect comfort food on a cold day!  The tortilla chips go perfectly and a grilled cheese on the side doesn’t hurt either  (especially if made with home made pimento cheese)!,2,2,positive
"aweseom, great flavor, changed a few things but that red pepper gives it a nice kick",2,2,positive
Absolutely loved this cake when is was in TOH magazine a few Christmas’s back. Made it that Christmas and Im making it again.,2,2,positive
"Soup needs onions and I won&#39;t be using brown sugar. As for the rice. I always cook it, or pasta in a separate pot as was suggested to me by a friend who is a chef. When you are ready to serve put rice, or pasta, in the bottom of bowl and ladle soup over the top. No gross, soggy rice or pasta ever again!",2,0,negative
"This was very good - comfort food is what my daughter called it.  I used a full lb. of ground beef, and added a few drops of sriracha sauce.  I will be making this again!",2,2,positive
<p>This recipe ROCKS!!!!! My family and friends love it! It is my go to recipe for something different in the weekly meal planning! been making it for years! Can&#39;t go wron making this one. The only thing I change is I delete the salt and you can&#39;t even tell it&#39;s missing. Great job and thank-you very much!</p>,2,2,positive
"We love this recipe, any one I make this for loves it and asks for it.  I would give it 5 stars but for one thing.  As delicious as it is, I think it is much improved with the addition of some cilantro.",2,2,positive

"This is my go to sweet bread recipe. I change it up with frozen mixed berries and lime, bake in 4 mini loaf pans but keep everything else the same. Great recipe!",2,2,positive
Delicious!  Most of the time I don&#39;t add the frosting which allows me to eat more without the added calories.  Also add extra cinnamon and will try the suggestion of using Splenda.,2,2,positive

"This chowder was delicious.  As do most of the Taste of Home subscribers, I made a couple of changes (we can&#39;t seem to resist doing that, can we) -- I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and chicken bouillon  granuals to reduce the sodium content  and I didn&#39;t have cheddar, so I used a combination of colby jack and a couple slices of  2%  Velveeta, because that was what I had on hand.  I also used less bacon to reduce the fat content.  Still an excellent chowder.",2,2,positive
excellent; I did add some candied ginger....about 2 tbs. but they are great just the way they are,2,2,positive
"I brought them to work and everyone loved them. They are easy to make, they come out very moist. They have a mild spice flavor I think next time I will add a little more spice or some pumpkin pie spice as suggested by previous reviewer. Other wise they are greatThanks for the recipe",2,2,positive
Fabulous.I didn&#39;t have applesauce so I used Canned Pumpkin.WOWWW! It was so wonderful.Thank you,2,2,positive
Awesome i made this for a party and next time i&#39;ll have to double it! Everyone wanted seconds!,2,2,positive
This is unbelievable. I used sliced baby portabella mushrooms  I added some leftover white wine it was really elegant.,2,2,positive
"My 9 year old daughter and I found this recipe while looking up what to make out of the ordinary with hamburger meat. She did most of it with me doing the cutting, and it was... Amazing! Probably the best soup I&#39;ve ever made and we were both hesitant at first before we started cooking it. We browned the meat with a half can of diced green peppers for a mild kick, and used baby red potatoes and I cannot wait to have leftovers again tonight!! We also made some homemade bread and stuffed a slice in each bowl and oh man it was wonderful!!",2,2,positive
Sounds delicious.  How many carbs per serving please.  Lots of diabetics in my family and we have to court carbs.,2,0,negative
A win with my family.... my husband was tasting before it went in the oven and said it can be eaten just like that....thanks for sharing this recipe.,2,2,positive
These muffins are great .  Such an easy Receipe to follow.  Baking time of 22 mins is too much though.  I could have timed it for 15 mins.  But the texture is soft.  Definitely making again.,2,2,positive
I made this tonight and I must say it is delicious.  I did take a couple of suggestions from others: 1)  I drained the zucchini for about 30 minutes then I pressed out as much moisture as I could in the strainer - then transferred to paper towel and blotted some more - my casserole was not runny;  2)  I added 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano and 2 minced garlic cloves to tomato sauce mixture and sauteed the green peppers with the meat and onion.  The sauce was anything but bland.  I will be making this recipe for a long time to come.  Thank you.,2,2,positive
going to try this tomorrow.  Sounds yummy,0,0,negative
Forgot to add that I used only 1/2 cup of butter (by accident) and it turned out just as good.,2,2,positive
"Best ever pot pie!! We added garlic to the onions and rosemary and parley to the spices.  Moisture and texture were a concern, but it was perfect. We all loved it!",2,2,positive
Won the office pot-luck with this great recipe! I think next time I&#39;ll add more cinnamon to the frosting. I also suggest that you keep the frosting @ room temprature until you&#39;re SURE you&#39;re finished with it as it&#39;s SUPER sticky and very hard to work with cold.,2,2,positive
I have made this for years and it is a family favorite! I do add a little cinnamon to apples.,2,2,positive
"I didn’t really care for this, but I am also not a big tomato sauce fan. It certainly didn’t live up to its’ hype. I used half ground beef and half sausage, with cheese ravioli.  I might try it again with extra cheeses and spices, but then again, I might not bother.",1,1,neutral
"This recipe is delicious. To the person who would like to substitute Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, that would work fine also but since Ricotta is alot more expensive you might consider just putting your cootage cheese through a food processor or blender and your cottage cheese hater will not know the difference.",2,2,positive
"I took this to a baby shower and people just raved about it. Thank goodness I doubled it, should have tripled it. So, so good. Thank you for this recipe.",2,2,positive

"Absolutely loved this!  My mom wouldn&#39;t eat it because of the pasta, but too bad for her!!  I made half the recipe since it was just myself to eat it.

"Made this for my son &amp; husband on the BBQ grill &amp; they loved it! I placed the fish in foil tents, poured the butter sauce over the fish, added cherry tomatoes and cooked on the grill for about 12 min or so. Served with Quinoa/brown rice mix &amp; grilled zuchinni with a homemade Thai mango dipping sauce. Very healthy &amp; delicious dinner that the family LOVED!",2,2,positive
"What a disappointment this dish was.  I love potatoes and could not wait to try this.  Too much sour cream and cheese for our tastes.  Wish I had only made half the recipe to try it.  You cant even taste the potatoes that well.  Made as directed except for the green onions, omitted them.  Won&#39;t be making this one again.",1,0,negative
Made as directed and was very good.,2,2,positive
"I have made this bread, large and small loaves and muffins, many times and it has turned out perfect everytime. I always use whole wheat flour and brown sugar and/ or a little honey, and cut back on they sugar a little. I also add blueberries, dried cherries, apple and rhubarb, sometimes separately or in some combination. They also add some sweetness so i can reduce the sugar, and extra   moisture to compensate for the whole wheat flour. The best banana bread anywhere and everyone that eats mine says the same thing! Thank you for sharing a great recipe!!",2,2,positive
"Good flavor, nice spice.  Mine came out overly sweet, though, for my taste and a bit heavy, not light and airy.  I had dried cranberries so I used those.  Next time I will try with fresh.",2,2,positive
"I use 1 cup of bananas, whatever nuts I have on hand.  Sometimes I add 1.5 cups blueberries (takes longer to cook).  Sometimes Apples.  I like to cook these in mini-loave pans.  I get four out of the recipe.  For Blueberry I cooked for 40-45min.  All others 30-35mins.",2,2,positive

Whenever I make it, and I follow the directions exactly, the jello always slides off the filling on people&#39;s plates. What can I do so it stays together on someone&#39;s plate?

This soup is WONDERFUL.  I don&#39;t like stewed tomatoes so I just used a can of diced.  I didn&#39;t add the extra chiles either.  Some may like a little more zing but I didn&#39;t want it to be too spicy.  Serve with a little cheese and corn chips.,2,2,positive
"Although this is delicious just the way it&#39;s shown, I find we like it even better with a can of cream of mushroom soup stirred into the sauce. This increases the gravy and gives it a nice creamy texture. It has a delicious flavor prepared this way.",2,2,positive

The crust came out just right crispness and the texture on the inside is delightful, soft, delicious.  I am so proud of how they turned out!  Easy to follow directions, will definitely use this recipe again.Edit:  My family tried it later in the day and all 4 of them lost their mind over the deliciousness, and I received specific compliments on crust and texture.  This bread is really a hit!",2,2,positive
"So good I&#39;m making these for my fall wedding!! Making sure the butter and cream cheese are at room temp helped ensure a silky smooth frosting. The spice level in both the frosting and the cupcake is spot on. The cupcakes have fresh, pure ingredients so they&#39;re heavier/denser than box mix cupcakes. These are on my Top 5 Cupcakes list!",2,2,positive
Need to bake longer.  Watch until golden brown and set.     Too good!,2,2,positive
"I had made this for my sons birthday party (during lent),and I had people ask for the recipe.I will be making this again and am so looking forward to it.It is creamy, rich and tastes like something you would get in an expensive restaurant.If your looking for something to serve to guests...this is it!",2,2,positive

I also whip the cream cheese and sugar separately and then fold them in together. I add a bit of Baileys Irish Cream to the frosting too, delish!",2,2,positive
"This was a great classic apple pie. It did come out looking wet but you have to let fruit pies cool before you cut them. I let mine cool overnight and it was perfect the next day- no run off and no soggy bottom. For those who say the apples weren’t tender, you need to test the pie by sticking it with something to make sure they are soft before you take it out. If your crust is getting too brown, put on a pie shield or foil.",2,2,positive

My family loves when I make this for dinner. The flavor is really good and I usually don’t have time to marinate the chicken for no longer than 30 min and it still comes out good. I’m sure if I took the time to marinate it longer the flavors would be even better but I’m fine with how it turns out.,2,2,positive

This is so delicious and so easy.  Definitely will make every week!  Thank you for making my life better with this easy and fun to make recipe!!  It’s totally awesome!  Will never buy fajita seasoning again!,2,2,positive
"WOW!!  Very moist, very flavorful and so easy to make.  You can definitely make just as the recipe reads or change it up.  I added only 1/2 cup sugar but sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on the top before baking.   It was plenty sweet!  I received praise from two co-workers who are gluten free and this is the best compliment.",2,2,positive
I realized I never reviewed this recipe and what an oversight that was!  This cake is amazing!  So easy too!,2,2,positive
Tasty is how my husband described this dish and my picky eater daughter said very good.  I used chicken breasts in this recipe.  Very good and easy.  The sauce was excellent.,2,2,positive

My family really enjoyed this. I made it in a 9x13 pan because I didn&#39;t have the right size.  So it came out cakey but was fine. Stored in the fridge. Tasted better cold to me. And made it a bit more dense. Not as light and cakey,2,2,positive

Works out well if cooked on stove top as well.  I have made this with ground turkey when I didn&#39;t have any leftover turkey to use because the family loves it!  It turns out tasty either way,2,2,positive
One of my absolute favorite recipes!!,2,2,positive
I prepared this also for my co-workers breakfast. I add little cinammon to give a better flavour and the taste. it was really a hit. I will make this again. thank you.,2,2,positive
"My pie did not turn out as expected, was very disappointed.  I&#39;ve gone over the recipe many times as I was sure it was something I did wrong, but I just can&#39;t figure out what it was.  I made 2 of these pies for Christmas and had to throw them both away.  I read the reviews and the caramel sauce is supposed to sink to the bottom, but how does sauce with 3 eggs in it sink?  It turned out like terrible caramel scrambled eggs on top.  I&#39;ve baked before and really can&#39;t figure out how everyone else can make it come out right, but mine was so terrible we couldn&#39;t eat it!",0,1,neutral

"This recipe was excellent! It was easy to make, too.  My husband even gave it 5 stars and he doesn&#39;t give many recipes that high a rating.  It would make a great dish for company.  Served it with brown rice,  Lemon Butter Green Beans and Strawberry Spinach Salad.",2,2,positive
"Fantastic flavor- quite zippy, too! the one major thing I&#39;d change is that the peppers got quite soggy cooking as long as the chicken. Next time I&#39;m going to add them at the earliest half-way through the chicken-cooking time. The rest of it was Fantastic!",2,2,positive
This is an awesome recipe! I ran out of soy sauce and only used a quarter cup - it was still fantastic! If you like teriyaki you&#39;ll like this!  I used boneless breasts and they were great.,2,2,positive

This is a wonderful cake. I also have made it in a 13 by 9 sheet cake and it is great. I wish that all those that rate without trying a recipe would please stop. There are forums to ask questions in to understand  components in the instructions BEFORE rating and this would be helpful to them and eliminate unfair ratings for the recipes.,2,2,positive
"I served this for 4th of July yesterday. I thought I&#39;d like it better than I did. It made a lot, which was a plus, but it was really missing something in the flavor. I found it unappealing and wished I&#39;d  served something else. Inhad 12 people for dinner; people ate it-- I had half a bowl left over. My husband said it was okay, and that he liked it well enough, but I didn&#39;t notice anyone really excited about it. Too bad. It sounded like something I&#39;d like.Perhaps I&#39;d like it with a different dressing. I think the dressing was a deal breaker for me. Maybe I&#39;ll try it again but use a favorite coleslaw dressing on it instead. Also, I wasn&#39;t crazy about the chestnuts. If I do it again, I&#39;ll use chopped jicama instead.",1,1,neutral
"My mom had made this cake for many, many years, it was one of her recipes,  that relatives new she would bring to a shower, or to a special family gathering.

We were always wondering, when she made it , was this cake for us, or was it leaving the house.....comfort food from our childhood I guess.",2,2,positive

"This recipe was so easy to make using the $6 rotisserie chicken from Costco and some impromptu home made salsa made from stewed tomatoes, onions, lemon juice and 2 canned chipotle adobo chiles for spice/flavor.  Made a full 9 x 12 tray which took longer to warm 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Tastes even better the second day!  A WINNER.",2,2,positive
So good!  My husband and I really liked it!  Better than my other white chili recipe!,2,2,positive
"I have made this several times in the past few months since I first spotted this recipe online.  I have jazzed it up a bit since I first tried it.  The first time I made it strictly by the book...,Ned while it was good, I felt like it was lacking something.  Taking my own cue for the traditional lasagna I typically make, the next time I made this I added some chopped onion and baby portabella mushrooms, and I used one package of ground beef plus I  added one pound of bulk Italian sausage.  Once thry were all cooked together, I  layered the ravioli  ( cheese only)  the sauce, the mozarela cheese, plus I also added a package of provolone cheese slices, divided, and I topped twitch one half a jar of Alfredo sauce.  I then repeated the ayers , endings with the red sauce and cheese, and baked as directed.  It&#39; is  a lot easier than putting the traditional lasagna recipe together.  I have served this to several friends, and they all love it!  Thanks for posting the original recipe, which has since morphed into my new favorite lasagna recipe!",2,2,positive
"Great taste on this bread but I&#39;ve tried it a couple times and I&#39;m having the same issue as a previous reviewer .  The sides brown way to much, long before the loaf is done . I tried doubling the recipe and making 3 loaves to cut the cook time but still had the same problem ...maybe ill try muffins out of it next time .",1,2,positive

I did not like meat loaf or meatballs until I tried this recipe.  I make this quite often and just love it!,2,2,positive
"I wouldn&#39;t give it 5 stars as is, but they are pretty good. The key to getting these to stay soft is to not over bake them (which is very easy to do) 10-12 min max. You almost have to take them out before they look totally done. Also, for those who had issues with spreading, it&#39;s likely also because of the use of only butter in the recipe. Butter makes cookies flatter. I used half butter, half butter  butter flavored crisco and that did seem to help. I think next time though I would use all crisco though.  I also nearly doubled the spices, I tasted the dough first and it just didn&#39;t have that ginger taste I was going for so I adjusted. Instead of rolling in sugar, I used a hard cookie glaze and dribbled it over them-- came out pretty great!",2,2,positive

"I have been making these bars for about 30 years, and my family and friends LOVE them. The only difference in my recipe is that I add 1/2 c. chopped walnuts to the batter, and instead of the cream cheese frosting. I make orange frosting (3 T. melted butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, 2 t. grated orange peel, and enough juice from one orange for spreading consistency) . Both are good; my family just prefers the fresh orange flavor.",2,2,positive
Everyone absolutely loved them and begged me for the recipe. I made according to recipe as written.,2,2,positive
"I have a &#34;family favorite&#34; banana bread recipe which is probably still the ultimate favorite, however, this bread is excellent as well.  And the reason I like it so much is that it is much lower in fat than the old family version.   For having only 1/2 cup of oil, in what turns out to be a very large loaf, I thought this was an exceptionally moist and flavorful bread.    I used 3 bananas instead of 2 since it was suggested by so many other reviewers.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly skipping only the nut since my family doesn&#39;t care for them.  Mine actually tested done after 1 hr and 10 mins.   The outer crust was slightly crunchy but not hard.    Will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.",2,2,positive
"I have been making this for years as a fall and winter staple. We use ground turkey and double the recipe. Every time i make it a little bit different and it never disappoints.  We love to use chicken bone broth, and swap out a can of corn for a can of the beans (since i double it i use 4 cans of beans and used whatever is on hand, but always keeping at least 1 can of black beans in) This freezes well and everyone loves it!!!",2,2,positive
"I love this bread.  I&#39;ve made double recipes all four times.  Once I made it vegan which was the only time that the bread didn&#39;t fall apart and leave its bottom in the pan.

I baked about 25 minutes longer and used a knife to test the pudding.  Because of the lower  oven temperature,  I felt that the pudding was slower to set! delowenstein",2,2,positive
"This was a good recipe because my family liked it. I guess I didnt care for it too much because it was so thick! It almost has too much cheese in it (is there such a thing?) So I would suggest maybe making it with extra beef broth, or bouillon cubes and water and topping it with cheese. For my personal tastes anyway...",1,2,positive
"Absolutely delicious!! Make sure to use fresh lemons and don’t skimp on the zest! I used confectioners sugar instead of granulated (I make a lemon cookie with the same glaze and love it, so that’s why I substituted). My husband was planning to take part of this to work to share with his coworkers and he loved it so much he changed his mind so he could eat it all himself! Perfect with coffee or tea!",2,2,positive
I made this cake for an auction.  The cake itself and rich and decadent.  The frosting seemed more like a mousse to me.  It wasn&#39;t too sweet but airy.

"After an abundant supply of zucchini I made these cupcakes several times this summer. Some went to work and many stayed home. I got rave reviews for these and even several requests for the recipe. As a TOH field editor I would highly recommend this recipe. It is an exceptionally easy recipe to make, the cupcakes were delicious and the icing was good also. If you wish to speed the icing process up a bit you can place the cooked part in ice and use an electric mixer. This way you can get to the finished product sooner. I froze several packets of zucchini premeasured just to make these in the winter. Try these you won&#39;t be dissapointed.",2,2,positive
These were heavenly but next time I am doubling the caramel sauce and saving half to drizzle over the frosting it was sooo good!,2,2,positive
Very good!! First apple pie I made..definately will make again!,2,2,positive
"LOVED THIS PIE. I made half a recipe (more or less) in a 10” pie plate with my favorite crust recipe. I didn’t have thyme so I used poultry seasoning, The corn was canned because that’s what I had, and the carrots were leftover roasted. No peas since hubs really can’t stand them, so I threw in some leftover green beans instead. And I used a combination of skim milk and half&amp;half, because again, it’s what I had. Pandemic baking, as another reviewer noted. But it was creamy and delicious, and next time I will make extra and freeze. Yum!",2,2,positive
"I have made this dish to pass at Church carry-ins and most recently to my In-Laws for Thanksgiving dinner!!! Everyone who has tried this has loved it!! It is easy to make and the thick, creaminess can&#39;t be beat! I almost always have the ingredients for this on hand. This is hands down my family&#39;s favorite homemade mac n cheese!",2,2,positive
"Amend the recipe to include real crabmeat and then add another star to the rating system and we have a winner with my family! A little pricey, because I have to double my recipe for my family, but worth every penny and is still less than the seafood dinners and more portions and better quality than dining out!",2,2,positive
Very smooth and the taste is great! This is my second time making it very good.,2,2,positive
"Made this tonight and we both loved it.  Since I just had regular tomato sauce, I added Italian seasoning and some garlic powder.  Definitely a keeper.",2,2,positive
lord hammercy ... this pie was a back breaker for me ... i had to keep thinning out the mixture with more chicken broth than anticipated ... but i finally got there ... thanks for a very tasty pie ... this recipe rocks ... will def make again !!!,2,0,negative
"This is a favorite recipe. The only change I make to it is that I mix up a package of alfredo sauce mix and add that to the pasta before serving with the scamp. Such an elegant dish, that I serve to guests. They will never guess it only takes minutes to prepare. I have even made it for people who don&#39;t enjoy seafood and watched them go back for seconds. Would highly recommend this recipe with the addition of the alfredo sauce.",2,2,positive
I used yougart instead of buttermilk and spiced it up with nutmeg and cinnamon. Delicious n moist!,2,2,positive
"It doesn&#39;t look anything like the picture, but it&#39;s EXCELLENT!!",2,2,positive
"Very bland recipe.  Throw some sriracha, honey, more pepper, onion, something!  Save this recipe somehow someway.",1,0,negative
"This is a keeper! I substituted what I had in the house, so I used 2 chicken boullion cubes in 2 cups water and 1/2 evaporated milk for the whip cream...It was DELICIOUS!  I will make smaller chicken pieces next time so there is chicken in every bite.  Highly recommend this recipe.",2,2,positive

My mom made these when I was growing up and she used a can of vegetable juice and  put flour on outside the balls and brought vegetable juice to a boil and added the balls in and the flour thickened the sauce. I do it the same way.,2,2,positive
I just made this banana bread and it is delicious! My honey likes a warm slice with butter on it. He kept asking for a piece before it cooled off. I will be making this bread over and over again.,2,2,positive

I loved it! This recipe is fast easy and &#34;deliciously creamy&#34;! I added a celery and pepper and my husband devoured it.,0,2,positive
THANK YOU I am a newly diagnosed diabetic Finally I found something I like with low carbs. I made it with almond milk b/c my doctor wants me to switch from &#34;real milk&#34; to this stuff and it was still really good. I am actually eating it right now for breakfast!,2,2,positive
This soup has been a top favorite of our family of 8 since the first time I made it back in Oct. 1996.  Many of our kids choose it for their birthday meal entrée.  It&#39;s wonderful with a hearty bread that&#39;s good for dunking in the soup.  Also good with chopped up dill pickles--my personal favorite touch. :),2,2,positive
Very good!  Super moist and flavorful.,2,2,positive
"I followed the instructions exactly, and baked for even longer than the recipe said (the video says 30-35, the written recipe says 35-40-I did 40).  It was brown on top.  I took it out, cooled it, put on the glaze and cut it.  It was still raw.  I&#39;m baking it again but it is probably ruined since it already glazed.  Haven&#39;t even gotten to taste it. :-(",1,1,neutral
"Bez,   my Mom&#39;s recipe does not use jello.  Crust is the same except 2 1/2 cups coarsely crushed pretzels.  Filling cream cheese and sugar only blended into 2 envelopes of whipped Dream Whip.  Topping is canned fruit pie filling.  Maybe this is close to your grandma&#39;s.  My mom passed a few years back so this is the best I can do.  Hope it helps.",2,0,negative
Haven&#39;t made the Enchiladas yet (have it in my Cook&#39;n file &amp; can&#39;t wait to try it next week) but used the sauce in the Chimichangas I made last night.  It added a great taste to them.  The reviews about how good the sauce is are accurate.  I typed the sauce recipe up separately &amp; will be using it for Mexican cuisine!,2,2,positive
This recipe was very easy to assemble and  bake. I didn&#39;t get quite as many cookies but it made a nice batch. We are enjoying them immensely.,2,2,positive
"Awesome!  My family nearly fought over who would get to take the leftovers to school and work with them, today!  (Do yourself a favor ... double the recipe!)  Absolutely one of the best pasta dishes I&#39;ve had, EVER.  Prep time takes a bit longer than noted, but worth every minute.  Company and special occasion worthy, hands down!",2,2,positive
"Definitely would add cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice to jazz it up.  Tastes a lot like a apple pie crumble.",2,2,positive
I was a bit disappointed because of the outstanding reviews.  The ingredients weren’t anything special and that is what I got.  My changes were that I precooked the cauliflower by roasting it  before adding it to the broth after the other vegetables were cooked.  I also used the Smokey hot sauce for more flavor.  I will be “doctoring” the leftovers as I serve it.,1,1,neutral
This recipe was a great introduction to the Asian Five Spice Powder. It seems to add so many great flavors that I could never seem to capture.,2,0,negative
"Absolutely delicious. I didn&#39;t have enough chicken broth, which is unusual for my house, so I used beef broth instead and it was delicious. My son who usually complains if I put celery in anything ate 2 big bowls and didn&#39;t even notice (I diced it very small). Thank you for sharing!!!",2,2,positive
I think this soup would be good make with chicken or even sausage. I love the thickness of it. It is so creamy and rich with flavor,2,2,positive
"This had good flavor, but using flour tortillas made the layers too thick and hard to cut and eat. If I make it again, I will use corn tortillas.",2,2,positive
"This is a taste of home classic that goes way back.  I&#39;ve made it meatless for the vegetarians in my life, but I personally like it better with the meat.  I always use chopped olives, not the sliced.  It makes fabulous leftovers...which is good because I will eat it every day until it&#39;s gone!  I like to bring this casserole in a disposable foil container when I need a meal to give to a family.  If you enjoy casseroles, this is the jackpot.",2,2,positive
"5 stars!!! This is the best gluten free bread recipe I have found yet! My daughter eats a banana every morning, usually not finishing them - so I stick them in the freezer for later. I&#39;ll be making this again soon, since she has already devoured 2 pieces!!! Thank you.",0,2,positive
"Tasty and easy to create but somewhat bland.  I will definitely make it again adding green &amp; red peppers, perhaps black olives.  My son added salsa as a topping saying it was perfect.",2,2,positive
very good. I didnt add the red pepper flakes cause I dont have &#39;em but it was still delicious.,2,2,positive
"It sounds yummy but after checking the ingredients I checked the Nutritional Info and wondered why anyone would make something with sooo many calories &amp; high fat content in 1 serving.  No wonder there are so many obese people!!  Let&#39;s eat right, exercise &amp; get healthy.",0,0,negative
"I added asparagus and thyme and upped the salt and pepper . I like it, but think it needs more flavor. Next time I might add some sherry.",1,2,positive

"Everyone who has had this, enjoys it.",2,2,positive
"loved  this!!!!  I only had a 1/2 pkg of cream cheese, so I made up the rest with banana yogurt.  I also added marchino cherries and dried apricots.  I like lots of fruit... Nice and moist",2,2,positive
"I made this chili for our Super Bowl party.  Everyone raved about how good it was and requested the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was simmered it all day so the flavors could meld and the chicken would be super tender.  It&#39;s not a real thick chili but that could easily be remedied by adding a little cornstarch, if that bothers you.  Otherwise, this is a delicious recipe and I&#39;m so glad I gave it a try.  It&#39;s a keeper!  :)",2,2,positive
I going to fix this cake next week for cards &amp; I&#39;m sure the girls will love it.,2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made these twice now to take to gatherings with friends, and they always receive great reviews! The only thing that I would note is that I don&#39;t think the recipe makes 7 dozen cookies. I made a half batch last night and probably got around 30 small cookies out of it.",2,2,positive
"This is an awesome dish!  I made it as directed, except the onion.  I only used one and it was plenty.  Will make this again.",2,2,positive
Next time I will try only one cup sugar.  I didn&#39;t have any buttermilk so added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar to the milk.  The only other change I made was using Saffola instead of canola.  My grandson suggests adding chocolate chips next time as he likes them in everything.  Really good and very moist.,2,2,positive
Loved the flavor and that it make a lot of cookies :),2,2,positive
Delicious!  My sauce was a little bit runny after it baked.   I&#39;ll be sure to  thicken it a bit more next time.  But this recipe is definitely a keeper!,2,2,positive
This bread was excellent. I&#39;m so excited to have found this easy recipe. I used honey instead of sugar and half whole wheat half all purpose flour delish. Thank you,2,2,positive
"Tasted this in a restaurant years ago, this is the closest to that recipe  I have ever had , it is wonderful.",2,2,positive
"I really didn&#39;t want to rate this because I have not tried this specific recipe. I just see people saying that it takes a long time to set. I make one similar. I don&#39;t use the eggs, milk or sugar and it turns out great. Takes about an hour at 350. Doubling the recipe will make it take about 30 minutes longer. I use half a box of jiffy corn muffing mix with the corn, sour cream, and butter.",2,2,positive
This was wonderful! I&#39;ve made it twice and got rave reviews and I&#39;m making it again this weekend.,2,2,positive

"Fantastic. Easy to make, a little messy, but the end result is tasty and leftovers were gobbled up just as quickly.",2,2,positive
Pretty tasty!  Followed the recipe exactly except I added a little more chicken broth and some instant white rice along with the wild rice (I used instant for both and added the last 5 minutes). Chopped the carrots instead of grating  them because we love carrots and wanted to really taste them.  Oh and I did add a little chicken bouillon seasoning powder.  Those changes were minimal the recipe stands on it&#39;s own.,2,2,positive
"Served this to a friend just last night. Every time I make it, people rave about it.",2,2,positive
"This was very good, but a little too soft for my taste. I think next time I&#39;ll  use less and see if that might firm it up.",2,2,positive
I had this at a pot luck at work and a co-worker refused to give me the recipe. Only thing different is she used crushed Butterfingers on top and it was awesome. Thanks for the recipe!,2,2,positive
This was really good but I made a few changes.... I bought a 19 ounce can of enchilada sauce instead of a 10 ounce can. I used about 16 ounces of it. I added a clove of minced garlic to the salsa,2,2,positive
"Tasty, hearty, filling...different enough to not seem like any other pasta dish.  Don&#39;t have veggie vans, then cut things small and they really won&#39;t notice.  Like the idea to next time add pepperoni.  Probably will double the parmesan on top.",2,2,positive
"I have made this recipe many, many times.  My family loves it!",2,2,positive
"Made it exactly as listed, but no shrimp. The flavor was wonderful, and my husband thought so too! We agreed that with all that wonderful flavor, the shrimp would be overpowered, anyway. My husband doesn&#39;t like rice and ate it like a bowl of stew!  Will definitely make it again.",2,2,positive
"This is definitely going to be a go-to recipe.  Nobody can believe it is healthy.  Make sure to use the small cake mix box (jiffy size), not the regular size.",2,2,positive
With a few minor differences this has been a favorite recipe in my home and community for a good many years.  We use only 1 can of cherry filling--I cannot imagine how wet it would be with 2 cans.  Try using an apricot pie filling for another very special treat.   Haven&#39;t made them for quite some time but we all cut them to be a generous size so the yield is not 60 out of a jelly roll size pan.farmerjoy,2,0,negative
"Two BIG thumbs up from our family of four. Easy, simple and delicious recipe. We halved and made in a 13x9 casserole dish. Cooled and drizzled the glaze, looks and tastes as good as it came from a bakery. Yes, i did bake an extra few minutes to obtain the golden color. Loved the almond extract flavor. Will be making again soon, I am sure, and would like to experiment with different fruit filling for variation. YUM!   PS- Just made a pan using peach filling, still amazing!!  This is a fabulous recipe.   :)",2,2,positive
Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!!  I had never made a pumpkin bread before and this was absolutely wonderful!!  It is very moist and delicious.  I put in the walnuts &amp; raisins and cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still sweet enough.  Even my husband ( who doesn&#39;t usually like ANYTHING pumpkin) really liked this!,2,2,positive
"Excellent dish!  I&#39;ve made it with (ground) beef, turkey, deer, and today I used elk.  I also make Homemade Tortillas (another Taste of Home recipe) just to make it as healthy as possible.  Thanks for sharing!!!!",2,2,positive
EVERYONE LOVES IT!,2,2,positive
"I have been making this recipe for years; it has become a family favorite! I usually make little individual pies to freeze with the extra filling. It is my go to, to bring to friends after surgery or tragic loss.",2,2,positive
"Pretty good recipe.  I made mine low-fat, low-calorie; ground turkey, no butter but 1 tbps when sauteeing veggies, 2% velvetta, RF sour cream, skim milk, etc.  Would make again but add about 4 oz more cheese this time, I didn&#39;t think it was cheesy enough.  Tasted better the next day heated up.",2,2,positive
"I have substituted/exchanged sweet potato and pumpkin in many sweet recipes.  A quicker and just as tasty version of this recipe would be to use an equal amount of sweet potato and, instead of a cream cheese frosting, remove cupcakes about 3 minutes early place a large marshmallow on top and return to the oven for the remaining time or until the marshmallows are slightly melted but still fluffy.",0,2,positive
I have made this recipe for years. It is Delicious.Re: one of the reviews This recipe is correct as written. There is another recipe for Frosted Banana Bars on the TOH site.that has 1 1/2 cups sugar and sour cream.https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/Frosted-Banana-Bars-2,2,2,positive
"I made it, it was easy to make, and I liked the buttery smooth texture and flavor. It complimented my 15 bean soup very well. Do I prefer corn bread without sugar? Depends on what mood I&#39;m in, and what I&#39;m eating it with. If I were having it with greens, I&#39;d probably prefer the old fashioned (NO SUGAR) cornbread.",2,2,positive
"Made this with my daughter, used a little less milk as I read in the reviews, came out amazing. Will be making this again",2,2,positive
This was so good.  The only thing I would do is leave out the salt and use lower sodium broth.  It was great just too salty.,2,2,positive
I have been making this recipe for years.  Everybody loves it.  I always make it without the meat for those darn vegetarians in our lives!  Meat on the side for the rest of us.  Always a hit!,2,2,positive

"I was looking for a quick and tasty recipe for our housewarming dinner (5 adults, 2 kids). Can I just say that this recipe was amazing. Not a labour of love like other lasagna recipes. There was plenty for everyone including left overs. I will definitely make this again.I use another reviewers suggestion: double the chicken broth and half the clam juice, and 4 spring onions, and black pepper instead of white (didn&#39;t have any). I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the seafood. Very nice recipe.",2,2,positive
"This is one great recipe. We love in the fall and winter, since it gives a great vegatable serving! We spice it up a bit by adding some cayenne and/or jalepeno peppers",2,2,positive
"I am not what you would call a professional cook, so making fajitas for the first time was nerve-wracking. But following this recipe and tweaking it to my liking, they were absolutely amazing! Even my mom enjoyed it, and she absolutely despises onions! They were 10x more delicious and flavourful than any fajita I&#39;ve had at a Mexican restaurant, and a huge improvement compared to our local one.  Personally, I used more lemon juice and a little less cummin. But since i like a little spice, I used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing. Fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too! I&#39;ve made it twice now and both times it&#39;s came out super delicious!",2,2,positive
Used it with some thin cut chicken breasts and had excellent flavor with the grill marks.  Can see why it would be great with thighs or wings.,2,2,positive

"This recipe is AMAZING!!! I am a complete Newbie when it comes to bread. I can make pizza dough like a pro but bread has always intimidated me.  Using bread flour in my recipe was my first priority, second was no milk or egg.  This recipe was easy to follow and ended up with a bread better than the bakery (my picky eater&#39;s words)!  I used a dough hook on my mixer and after was pulled together, i hand kneaded it for about 4 minutes longer.  The most perfect bread ever!!!  Don&#39;t be intimidated, just follow written directions fully.  ONLY thing I would add is to put the rack toward the bottom so the &#34;poof&#34; of the bread is in the middle of the oven when it&#39;s risen and browning.  THANK YOU AGAIN!!!",2,2,positive

Let&#39;s give this a try.&#34; Miracle of all miracles, they both liked the soup! Instead of garnishing with sour cream, we used a few spoonfuls of pickle relish because whenever my daughter orders a cheeseburger in a restaurant she orders it with &#34;pickles, extra pickles, and more extra pickles.&#34;",2,2,positive
Wowwwwww so good! Love it!,2,2,positive
I introduced this dish to my family for our 2008 Christmas dinner.  This seafood lasagna was very delicious! I appreciate that the recipe was well written.

"Love this easy, flavorful, summer recipe! If you are a key lime pie snob, it’s obvious from the ingredients that it is not going to be “true “ key lime pie; however, call it creamy lime flavored pie! Either way, mine came out delicious and it is great to serve on a warm summer evening. I used Chabani key lime flavored yogurt, just because I love the flavor of this yogurt by itself! Stick it in the freezer for about an hour before serving, and it’s like eating an ice cream pie! Yummy!",2,2,positive

I am by no means a baker last time I made bread was 5 yrs ago I know this because my mom passed in 2015. This recipe is easy and tastes wonderful.  Tip since yeast is the new toilet paper during this virus find a local bake shop and ask them is you can buy some yeast I found fresh and it had expired and worked beautifully just proof it like active dry yeast. Cheer and good luck.,2,2,positive

"I had leftover ham from Sunday dinner, so I decided to try these. Everyone really enjoyed these sandwiches. Make sure to use horseradish sauce, or the horseradish may be over powering. The grocery store near my home sells Hawaiian mini sub rolls (about the size of two regular rolls), so I used these. I didn&#39;t have poppyseed so I used deli mustard which had seeds. I also used one and half tablespoons of mustard and brown sugar. I stuck the sandwiches in the freezer for an hour before baking because I didn&#39;t realize they needed to be refrigerated for several hours until I started making dinner. Turned out wonderful.",2,2,positive
"I loved it and my guest did also!  I cut it in half for two people.  I pounded  then instead of putting flour on it I sprinkled it with McCormicks Perfect Pinch Garlic &amp; Herb salt free.

"A bit too rich for my taste. If I make it again, I think I would do a light whipped cream topping with strawberries rather than the frosting from this recipe (which just felt like *too much*).",1,1,neutral
"This was excellent. I thought it would be bland but it was full of flavor and my guest raved about it. I used frozen cauliflower, almond oil and basil olive oil because that is all I had on hand. I pureed the vegetables and served it as an entree. There was enough for four people, not eight but we were all satisfied. Everyone asked for the recipe.",2,2,positive

Made this for bookclub and it was delicious.  Took the rest to work the next day and it was a hit!,2,2,positive
"I make this, but not with a tomato base. First, I use instant rice mixed with the hamburger meat, minced garlic, minced mushrooms, &amp; diced up onion. I baked the meatballs(350° 15-20 mins or until done.) In a large pot, I cooked a 3-4 servings amount of the instant rice per box instructions,  I then add 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with needed amount of milk. Once soup is smoothly mixed in with rice, I add the meatballs. Heat on low to medium heat until heated through.",0,1,neutral
I used regular jello the other day in mine and had no problem.  Maybe too much water?,0,0,negative
"Loved it! I used 1/2 chunky mango habanero salsa, and 1/2 standard hot, and the texture was great, not runny at all. I usually make my own taco seasoning, and just mixed in some chile powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne, salt/pepper, and fresh garlic. I also added minced serrano pepper. I did make a couple minor substitutions: shallots instead of onion, and monterey jack instead of mexican cheese. The only problem was I ate way too much.I think next time I&#39;ll try corn tortillas and maybe add a can of corn.",2,2,positive
"This recipe is so easy and delicious.  I like it because it doesn&#39;t have mustard in the recipe.  I have made this twice and delicious every time. Also, I sliced the onions thin once and diced them the other time.  Both times delicious.",2,2,positive
Tried this recipe for the first time and I was very pleased with the results. I can&#39;t offer any suggestions for improvements. Very simple recipe. If you follow directions precisely you will get some really great bread. Hope it stays fresh for a couple days. Definitely worth making again!,2,2,positive

"This was the first recipe I ever tried from taste of home back in 1994. It has been a family favorite. I can&#34;t begin to tell you the number of times I have made it or the number of recipes I have given out. The only thing I do differently is instead of diced tomatoes, I use crushed. My family does not like big chunks of tomatoes",2,2,positive
I made these for a party I was hosting on a chilly fall evening and they were fantastic and a huge hit! They turned out very moist and the flavor was wonderful. I cut the frosting recipe in half and am glad I did because this was plenty. I tried them with and without the frosting and liked them both ways. The frosting is not necessary but really does make them just a little more special. They went well with the spiced hot apple cider I served and I will make these again.,2,2,positive
I made this last night and my family absolutely loved it it was the first time my kids ever had chicken pot pie I used mix vegetables instead of the carrots and peas separate and added celery salt I made 2 pies and it was all gone in 35 min great recipe after that my wife wants me to cook every night,2,2,positive

I followed this recipe exactly and it was pretty awful.  It tasted like mayo with a little bacon flavor thrown in.  This is the first time I&#39;ve made a recipe with this many good reviews that turned out so badly.  Beware unless you love eating mayo straight from the jar.,0,0,negative
This is lucious.  Made it for teachers for a dinner and everyone raved over it.  None left.,2,2,positive
"At first, I made the recipe exactly as written. The flavor was great, but they spread a lot in the oven. The second time, I whipped the egg whites until fluffy and then gently folded in the remaining ingredients. No more spreading, and I was able to get more cookies out of the mixture. So yummy!",2,2,positive
Made this for the first last week and have cooked it four times by special requests from family...they all LOVE it...i use 2 pounds of ground beef and increased other ingredients accordingly.  Since my family does not like catsup I use Sweet Baby Ray original sauce..this meatloaf is gourmet.  I also substitute Saltines in favor of Club or Ritz Crackers.  Instead of bulb onion I used about 6 green onions including the green parts.  This meatloaf has lots of flavor!,2,2,positive
"I loved this recipe, it was perfect, although, I did add a little minced garlic.  This is a keeper!",2,2,positive
These were really good.  They turned out much more spikey and porcupine-looking than the picture shows.,2,2,positive
*I made this last night for our girls&#39; game night dinner and everyone loved it!

I will definitely make this again!,2,2,positive

"Excellent as written! I love that this contains no canned soups(though I do use them for convenience sometimes). I used rotisserie chicken for this. Love the tip about the slumped crust! I learned something new. Lynne, Volunteer Field Editor",2,2,positive
"I just pulled these out of the oven and couldn&#39;t wait until the bread was cool to taste - they are SO GOOD!  Next time I will take the advice of a few others to bake it in one larger loaf pan instead of two.  They were fine in the two, but I didn&#39;t have the exact size.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated other than adding the nuts because one of my granddaughters is allergice to tree nuts.  Great texture!",2,2,positive
"Excellent, good for a crowd.",2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made this soup twice in the past 10 days! My family loves it. I added more meat for our liking. I used about 1.25 lbs of (very lean) ground beef. I increased the broth to 4 cups, the milk to 2 cups and used half a large (I think a 2 lb brick) container of Velveeta. Hubby suggested adding some bacon which sounds fabulous.",2,2,positive
"This is a family favorite!  I use canned chicken, reduce the broth and add a can of corn.  Perfect with hot cornbread!",2,2,positive
very nice and fluffy. my family loved it. soft and spongy. I added  3 tablespoons of coco powder to theflour and it turned out really well. thanks for such sweet recipe.,2,2,positive

Fantastic!  My whole family loved the flavor.  Definitely a keeper.,2,2,positive
I found this recipe a couple of years ago.  It is one of the most requested recipes by my family in the fall and winter.,2,2,positive
"Absolutely delicious. Instead of layering, I just laid all the potatoes in the dish and spread the sour cream over the potatoes, sprinkled onion and bacon, salted and peppered, then sprinkled cheeses on the top. Came out great! Definitely a new family favorite.",2,2,positive
"These were delicious.  Granted, my frosting looked nothing like the picture (not as fluffy), but the taste of both the cupcakes and the frosting was outstanding.  This won rave reviews with my family, the neighbor kids, and my coworkers (I made a dozen cupcakes for home and then used the rest of the batter to make a small cake that I took to work).  Everyone loved the frosting and I had a bunch left over, so I used it on some gluten-free apple muffins I&#39;d made for my daughter (since she couldn&#39;t eat these).  Would definitely make these again and am going to experiment with a GF version and with using more zucchini.My husband tried to get me to agree that he could have as many as he wanted since &#34;they contain veggies!&#34;  Hahah.",2,2,positive
"Easy &amp; delicious.  I&#39;ve made it with cauliflower as the main ingredient, and also combined cauliflower with broccoli.  Very good each time.  Goes great with any sort of sandwich.",2,2,positive
I made this tonight and it was excellent!  I used 2 chicken breasts and 6 boneless skinless thighs.  The only thing I had to do was increase the cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce but that is no big thing.  It was super good and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll make it again soon!,2,2,positive
Very good.  Hubby liked it a lot.  I agree that adding rice or beans to the meat would be a good option.  I used half the amount of salt and the minimum amount of chili powder as per other&#39;s ratings. Depends on how hot you want it.  Some said it was mushy so I didn&#39;t cook it as long.,2,2,positive

i done ALOT of changes to fit my weird eating habits... I mixed the salt &amp; black pepper 2gether - so it measured out to 1/4t - I used low sodium bacon bits or crumbles - used a Mexican blend of cheeses - added red &amp; green bell peppers diced - and added the bottom 1/2&#39;s of the green onions to the casserole - sprinkled more of the green onions toppings to the potatoes... EVERY1 loved it! will b making it again... for sure!,2,2,positive

Made this for my family and they all loved it. I personally would add more potatoes and slightly more seasoning but other than that this recipe is simple but delicious. My family said it was better than Logan&#39;s (a restaurant).,2,2,positive
"This was good but can use improving - I used 8 eggs, didn&#39;t have swiss cheese so used some sour cream, added salt (and it still needed some when I served it!). Very good idea and you can definitely play with the recipe, add ingredients that you like!",2,2,positive
I&#39;ve made this many times and even made it for a party. I used kielbasa sausage and had the shrimp to add on the side.  I loved that the veggies were still crunchy and sometimes the times on slow cooker recipes are too long and the food is cooked too much.  This one is right.Thanks.,2,2,positive
"Last Christmas starting December first, my family and I decided that we wanted to make a different kind of cookie every day for the whole month of December. Well, we needed cookie recipes so I decided to look on tasteofhome, and stumbled upon this recipe. We absolutely love these cookies, they are amazing, the molasses and ginger blend very well together and just like the title, they are big and soft! We make these all the time, my brother had some friends over and said that they wanted cookies so I decided to make these for them, and they ate the WHOLE batch! One his friends said that they were the best cookies he ever tried. Would definitely recommend making these cookies for any occasion. Happy Baking!",2,2,positive
100% Delicious!!!!!  This recipe is a winner to my family and I. Very Easy and FUN!!!!,2,2,positive

"I marinated the chicken a full day and it seemed to be missing something. We happen to like a little more spice. I agree with other reviewers that it might be better with lime, but I didn&#39;t have any. . I probably won&#39;t use this recipe again.",1,1,neutral
"I pulled this recipe out of the recent Taste of Home magazine.  I was looking for a quick meal to make and I had all the ingredients on hand, with some swap outs.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Sauteed a half an onion with it. I thought that 6 C of water would be too much, so I cut back to 4 C and used 1 whole low sodium beef bouillon cube.  For the diced tomatoes, I used (2) 14.5 oz cans and partially drained them before dumping in the pot.  I only used about 2 tbsp of the brown sugar and no additional salt.  Instead of rice, I served it on top of &#39;cauliflower rice.&#39; It was a hit.  I&#39;m giving this a 5 because the flavors are amazing and I&#39;m betting will taste even better tomorrow!",2,2,positive
I made this recipe hundreds of times starting back in 2000 when it first appeared in the magazine AND I was a newlywed.  My 13-year-old likes it and my 8-year-old just started to like it.  I just leave out the crushed red pepper flakes and I use red onion.  This recipe is in regular rotation in this house.,2,2,positive
"I have made this and it is delish. I have also used boneless chops and instead of the chicken broth, I have used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with a 1/2 cup of sour cream. Both are wonderful.",2,2,positive
"This was amazing! I chose different shredded cheeses mixed mild cheddar, colby and sharp cheddar. I added about 2 TBS evaporated milk and used 1 1/2 2% milk and it was very creamy. Like the recipe states, &#34;USE AS MUCH MILK AS NEEDED TO CREATE DESIRED RESULT&#34; I will definitely be making this one again!",2,2,positive
"<p>My sister-in-law brought this to our last family get together.  It was fantastic.  She sent us all the recipe, as we all raved about it.  I can&#39;t wait to make it at my next get together with friends.</p>",2,2,positive
Very tasty and filling.  Great way to use up leftover chicken.  I used evaporated skim milk for the milk which gave it an extra creamy taste without adding any more fat and I used fresh thyme and a heavy sprinkle of poultry seasoning.  I made four deep dish individual pies and I could only eat half of one.,2,2,positive

"This soup is good and easy to make.  I did make a few changes--I used leftover chicken, 3 cans beans, a little extra water to simmer in, and I left out the cream because I didn&#39;t want it any thinner.  I would use milk to thin if needed.  It was yummy and easy.",2,2,positive
Excellent recipe!  I&#39;ve tried several other potato soup recipes which we like but both my sons said this one was the best and asked me to make again!  My husband liked it as well but thought I should reduce the salt a little bit.,2,2,positive
"This is extremely delicious and amazing with a cup of coffee. I shared the recipe with my sister, she also bakes frequently.",2,2,positive
"I added some V-8 juice as needed to thin the sauce while it simmered for the hour. I added onion, green pepper, fresh mushrooms, bay leaf, extra garlic, and Italian seasoning. And towards the end of the hour, some fresh basil.To the  layers I added one of fresh spinach. I am SO glad I found this recipe! I have made it twice, once with beef and sausage, and once with beef and plain ground pork. Both were awesome! Thank you for this recipe!",2,2,positive

"Great Recipe.  I also altered it as recommended by other users.  I only used 1/2c sugar as my banana&#39;s were really ripe.  I used three banana&#39;s and added 1tsp of cinnamon and used 1/4c of coconut oil .  My bread was done after 40min so keep your eye on it, as it does not take over an hour to bake.  Next time I might add baking powder, as mine didn&#39;t come out as high and fluffy as I would have liked it.",2,2,positive
I have made this dish for years.  I don’t like olives so I leave them out.  I love this dish because it doesn’t taste like spaghetti.  It’s just plain good,2,2,positive
"Just made this and will be making it again but found it a bit bland, so the next time I make it I&#39;ll be adding a little heat and different (more pungent) cheese combination.  I didn&#39;t saute the red peppers and loved it that way.  Hubby just went for seconds - a good sign.  Update:  Just realized I used tomato sauce instead of a spiced Italian sauce.  My bad.  Trying it again - this time I&#39;ll read the directions more carefully.",2,2,positive

"I was really skeptical about the fat free half and half  and flour in this recipe, but I&#39;ve been on Weight Watchers and really craving New England clam chowder so I thought I&#39;d give it a try. It worked like a dream, thickened up perfectly and tasted rich. No one could tell it was lower in fat. I also added celery with the onion, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. My family and guests thought it was great and finished every drop. In the past I&#39;ve added a splash of lager or pale ale to my chowder (not canon, I know, but I like it) and I may do that with this recipe in future. It just adds a little depth to the flavor.",2,2,positive

I usually have a &#34;thing&#34; about eating meat off the bone; while I started my dinner carving off the chicken, I quickly progressed to picking the thigh up for some seriously un-lady-like gnawing. It&#39;s that good.My picky-eaters (9 and 12) ate it slowly, but didn&#39;t complain, which is highly unusual for a new flavor. I will be making this again (and again and again....)",2,2,positive

I liked this because I felt it was a little different than the typical baked spaghetti casserole.  My boyfriend said he would have liked it better with more tomatoes.  I personally like the cream of mushroom sauce on the top and wouldn&#39;t change it if it were for just me.,2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve been making this for about 10 years now and it&#39;s always been a winner. I think the people that are saying the cream layer is too thin are beating the mixture too much. I just fold my ingredients together and it stays nice and fluffy and is plenty to cover a 13x9 pan. I&#39;ve also had an issue with the jello mixture leaking through to the pretzel layer but I know each time it happened, I didn&#39;t make sure the cream layer went all the way to the edges. That is important. But if it does leak through, it&#39;s still pretty darn tasty.",2,2,positive

I used heavy cream in place of 2% milk. I also added 3 cubed hard boiled eggs after the potatoes were cooked. That&#39;s how we Pennsylvania German people make it. I&#39;m thinking a non-processed cheese might be better.,2,2,positive
"This is our favorite main dish zucchini recipe!  Just top it with whatever your favorite pizza toppings are if you want more flavor than the ground beef.  I usually use the ground beef, onion, tomato sauce layer then might add some pepperoni, olives, sausage, additional onion, mushrooms......whatever I want on my pizza.   Love it, love the results, not watery at all.",2,2,positive
Made this and it&#39;s fabulous... Now I need to double the recipe... Has anybody doubled it??? If so what size casserole did you use??? Plus how long did you need to bake it??? Or would you recommend make two casseroles??? Thank You...,2,2,positive
"This was good...I added chopped spinach and cherry tomatoes as I needed to use them up. Next time will broil the shrimp mix on top of the noodles. It made a very pretty, crusty presentation that had to be broken up when putting on the pasta. Also next time I will peel and de-tail the shrimp first!",2,2,positive

My husband and I loves these cookies.  This time I&#39;ll try beating the egg whites to soft peak.  Thanks for sharing.,2,2,positive
"This is a complete favorite of all my friends, family, and co workers. I do not modify anything other than a few more minutes cook time and I use light sour cream. For all the people saying it takes way longer or is dry (HOW!?) It is not supposed to &#34;set&#34; from cooking. The very center should very slightly jiggle when done, and if you poke it with a knife is should partially come out clean. If you make this in advance do NOT over cook. It will &#34;Set&#34; as it cools.",2,2,positive
"We made this last night and no leftovers for today! This is delicious and so flavorful. Made it like the recipe says with only these substitutions...had boneless, skinless thighs instead of the breasts and used a precooked package of shrimp. The chicken thighs were just as good in it and I stirred in the shrimp just before serving, long enough for shrimp to get hot. This dish is spicy but not mouth burning spicy. As my hubby said, it is spicy but not enough to make his bald spot sweat! We will definitely be making this again!",2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made this 3 times in a week...after reading some of the other reviews, I cut oil to 1/4 c and used 1/4 applesauce. I also cut sugar back to 1 cup and never missed the 1/2 cup of sugar! Today&#39;s loaf came out delicious!",2,2,positive

"I tested out this recipe for the first time. I&#39;d omitted the capers and scaled back on the butter, lemon juice, garlic powder and kept the salt and paprika as is.  I used Italian seasoning, crushed-about 1/2 tsp. I used a smaller pan (an 8-inch square baking pan, coated with non-stick cooking spray.  I used 1 Tbsp. to 2 Tbsp. sweet pickle relish in place of the capers. The butter, I&#39;d used 2 Tbsp.-the lemon juice, I&#39;d used 1 to 2 Tbsp. and garlic powder I&#39;d used 3/4 tsp.  I baked fish for 15 minutes.  This is a very tasty dish! It&#39;s moist, too!  The sauce adds a nice flavor! delowenstein",2,2,positive
"My granny god bless her use to serve this up to me decades ago and said its a poor man&#39;s soup.

I also fry bacon or add chunks of ham to the soup.  SO GOOD!",2,2,positive

I made this on Christmas Eve to serve Christmas morning.  I am so glad I did!  It was easy and delicious—even reheated great with a splash of milk to loosen it up a few days later.

"I had great hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews, but we were very disappointed.  I made it for dinner last night and the only adjustments I made were to add white wine to produce more sauce but it was still far too dry and to top the pasta with the shrimp mixture before broiling  We also thought it was very bland; with the amount of garlic and lemon juice we thought it would taste better.  I&#39;ve been thinking about how to improve it: add lemon zest?  saute the shrimp in the butter/oil instead of simmering in the liquid?  I&#39;ve decided to use other shrimp scampi recipes instead.  The crispy broiled topping was wonderful so will try that with another recipe.",0,1,neutral

"this is for toothfairylin. The answer to your question is.. are you using cheese that is already shredded? I found this out the hard way when I was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese. If you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesn&#39;t stick together. Also you don&#34;t really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store. So freshness does matter. It is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself. Since I have been doing that, all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly. I got this tip from Paula Dean. It was a question she answered from her cooking magazine. I hope this helped you.",2,0,negative
This dessert was a fluffy little piece of lime heaven!  I used regular jello and whipped topping as some other reviewers did.   This would be a perfect dessert for a summer gathering.  It just tastes like summer and is so easy!,2,2,positive
"This was my first foray into baking an apple pie. I&#39;ve done lots of different cakes, pies, and cupcakes, but I&#39;ve been a limited intimidated with the apple pie. Well, my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so, it was the right time to just go for it. I chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward. I did read through many of the reviews, which are very mixed--from best pie to worst pie. Honestly, that made me a little nervous, but I decided to remain positive and give it a shot. The result was spectacular!!! I had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy. He said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice. I took the next slice, and I was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how  well everything came out.  I will note that I followed the directions, without any changes. I used only Granny Smith apples and I didn&#39;t have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough. The pie&#39;s taste is amazing. I thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly. Honestly, the hardest part for me was making the crust, which I also decided to do for the first time. I was actually worried most about the double crust, but it somehow all worked out. Phew! I would definitely recommend this recipe. It&#39;s worth taking a chance.",2,2,positive
This recipe is fantastic and easy to make.  I served Asian Peanut coleslaw with it.,2,2,positive

[Wow - what happened to all the reviews I saw here a week or 2 ago? There&#39;s only 1 review showing here now.] This IS the BEST banana bread - no kidding! Use 3 bananas to have an overflowing cupful. (I used an aluminum-colored loaf pan.) You will love it! -Lori in WI.,2,2,positive
"I have been making this exact pie for many years but in my recipe I have 1/4 tsp cloves instead of ginger, which I do prefer. I like my pie mildly sweet so I only add 1/4 cup each of the sugars. I find the apples have a good amount of there own sugar, even Granny Smiths. I also blind bake my bottom crust, I find the crust doesn’t  become soggy this way. This is an excellent  recipe.

This is my favorite soup! I’m not a fan of mushrooms so I leave them out and use Cream of Chicken with Herbs (or Cream of Celery). I purée the soup with the 1/2 cup of broth (or wine). I also add a half cup of toasted blanched almond slivers. A little extra chicken and rice make a thicker soup (I use a wild rice blend). Everyone loves this soup!,2,2,positive

"This recipe is amazing! We changed it slightly by replacing the marinating step with putting it in a crockpot on low for 8 hours.  Then we threw the chicken on a hot grille for just a couple of minutes per side. The chicken fell right off of the bone and because the chicken cooked in the marinade, we were able to use it over rice which was heavenly. Thanks for the recipe.",2,2,positive

"This is an excellent recipe, especially if you&#39;re a beginner. It tastes way better than buying them ready made. I would however suggest only making this if you&#39;re used to spicy food because the amount of chili in this recipe is far more than regular taste buds can handle so If you&#39;re thinking about following this recipe you should half the amount of chili you use . But for the rest this recipe is perfect!!",2,2,positive

"Great Recipe.  I also altered it as recommended by other users.  I only used 1/2c sugar as my banana&#39;s were really ripe.  I used three banana&#39;s and added 1tsp of cinnamon and used 1/4c of coconut oil instead.  My bread was done after 40min so keep your eye on it, as it does not take over an hour to bake.  Next time I might add baking powder, as mine didn&#39;t come out as high and fluffy as I would have liked it.",2,2,positive

"I made this during Corona virus shut down so I made adjustments to what I had.  I used cream of bacon soup instead of the cream of mushroom as I couldn&#39;t find any at the store and I was out,  I halved the recipe and didn&#39;t have the dried parsley but I did everything else pretty much as the recipe called for.  I used canned wild rice because I always have that on hand.  It was delicious.  My husband loved it and told me he&#39;d be glad to have that again, so It will go into my soup collection but I think I&#39;ll stick with the cream of bacon soup because we really liked the subtle depth it gave the soup.",2,2,positive
"tried this recipe for Christmas Dinner. I did make a few modifications. I used 1 pound of Maine lobster meat, 1 lb of sea scallops (cut in quarters)  and 1 lb fresh Maine shrimp.  I also increased the lasgana noodles to 4 noodles abreast, for a total of 12.On a scale of 1 to 10, this meal was a 15.. My husband &#34; the red meat eater&#34;, said it would be a toss up between my notorious prime rib meal, or this new recipe. It was easy to make, and the flavor undescribable.  He even mentioned he wanted to lick his plate. You will not be disappointed if you try this .  10 Stars in my book.",2,2,positive

I made it with 1.5lbs of ground beef, skipped the onion b/c we use chunky salsa, added half a bag of sweet corn (for crunch), mixed in the sour cream and used a whole pkg of taco seasoning.  I was so hungry that I had a taste on a tortilla chip and we actually ate it like that for dinner!  Put some in a bowl, topped with shredded cheese and voila!  As my 4yo says, &#34;!Delicioso!&#34;</p>",0,2,positive

"Incredible!!I had to make a few changes - I didn&#39;t have buttermilk, and ran out of vinegar and lemon juice to make buttermilk, so I used 1/4 cup of 1% milk and added 1 tbsp of orange juice to it - I also used 3 large bananas (so important that they are partially green, not completely ripe!) - and I also added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed as well. I also reduced the sugar from 1 1/2 cups to just 1 cup - although you could still reduce it more. I added a dash of nutmeg, a dash of ground cloves, and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I really enjoyed reading everyone&#39;s reviews and suggestions too! It helped me with making my own changes - thanks for a great starting point with this recipe - it&#39;s a keeper!",2,2,positive
"As a pie lover, it is difficult for a pie to really impress me. This recipe not only impressed me, it changed me. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the glaze as other reviewers suggested.

Easy and always a crowd-pleaser!,2,2,positive
Making this again tonight because it is a favorite at our house. The flavor and consistency are great when hot and even better the next day on a sandwich. I make my mini loaves bigger than suggested - 4 loaves instead of 8. One pound of meat only serves 4 here.,2,2,positive
Delicious!  Easy too.  I would like to hear about some different frosting ideas for it. I did like it plain and  also with a little powdered sugar.   I&#39;m just curious.,2,2,positive
"Very delicious, tasted like doughnuts and were very sweet. Imwould modifynthe recipe to make it more diabetic friendly.  I added vanilla, cinnamon and poudre douce which probably gave it moremof the dessert flavour. No syrup required!  Yummy!",2,2,positive
I made this for Christmas dinner and the entire family loved it.  I would absolutely make this again.,2,2,positive
Flexible! I skipped the carrots and celery cause I’m not a fan of those flavours and opted for mushrooms and broccoli instead. I used duck fat in lieu of butter and duck stock in lieu of chicken because that’s what I have. I used whatever cheese was in my fridge: left over taco mix and cheddar. It was still delicious! I love a recipe that’s easy to adapt. Thank you!,2,2,positive
my favorite apple pie recipe.  Sometimes I add a little pumpkin pie spice as well just to spice it up a notch,2,2,positive
"Such a great recipe and easy for this beginner to follow. You saved our Christmas! Last year my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s and she&#39;s the one that made Christmas with her cooking and baking. Dad has been her caregiver ever since and has been cooking like a champ. My husband and I live 2min. away, and my brother is staying with them and has been a huge help. But none of us were ready for the holidays... Not really  Last year I did NOTHING. This year we cooked what we wanted instead of trying to mimic what mom did.  Fried catfish and shrimp, anyone?I also was able to make homemade bread and ham for the family. A tradition that&#39;s been in place for as long as I can remember and I&#39;m 50. They loved it! Thank you 1000x and happy holidays!",2,2,positive
This made a perfect Christmas gift for my family. I did add the vanilla and used part evaporated milk part 2% milk.  Thanks for sharing.,2,2,positive
Great! Works well with chicken legs. Used brown sugar rather than white. Sauce did not thicken up as well as expected,2,2,positive
Made this cake. It was great. Topped it with brown sugar frosting. Everyone loves it. Everyone must try brown sugar frosting. Just cut the powdered sugar in half and it has the perfect amount of sweetness.,2,2,positive
Delicious and the pumpkin gave it a different flavor,2,2,positive
"I was very excited to try this recipe based on all the great reviews.  I liked the simplicity of the recipe and the beef filling for the enchiladas was pretty tasty.  However, I was not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce.  I have made other from-scratch enchilada sauces I&#39;ve liked better - I think this one called for too much flour for my taste - it got pretty thick, almost the texture of canned tomato soup before you add water to it.  The overall taste was good though - we even ate leftovers the next day, but this is most likely not a recipe I&#39;ll save to make again.",1,1,neutral
This will definitely go in our family favorite cookbook!! Yummy!!,2,2,positive
Very good soup!  I did half of the recipe for my husband and I and it was the perfect amount for us to eat once with leftovers a couple of times.I left out the jalapeno peppers since we do not like spicy food. I also kept it in the crock pot for a couple of hours on warm since I needed to make the meal a while before we would be able to eat. Turned out great!,2,2,positive

"I made this for supper tonight with a few modifications. I used lean ground turkey instead of beef. I didn&#39;t have any Italian dressing so I used Catalina. Other than that I followed the recipe. We had our salad as a starter instead of on top of the casserole. It made for a very satisfying dinner. My husband loved it. Mine didn&#39;t look like the picture tho&#39;-it was quite runny even after sitting the five minutes, but I will definitely be making it again.",2,2,positive

"I made this over the weekend and planned on using it for a couple of meals throughout the week.  My suggestion?  Do not put the rice in until you are ready to eat it.  I put all the rice in, and the next morning, it was just a big ball of rice...all the liquid absorbed.  I was very disappointed.",2,1,neutral
Great recipe! I like light fluffy cakes so I added some more baking powder and add a little baking soda.,2,2,positive
"This is so good! It is always requested in our house. The only changes--  I use broth instead of water, add 1/4 cup chopped onion to the carrot mixture, and cayenne instead of hot sauce. Yum!",2,2,positive
"My family loves this recipe.  I altered it and added corn starch to make it a bit thicker.  Plus, we use crushed tortilla chips on top as a garnish.",2,2,positive
This was simple to make but  had a flavor that will  make your family think you have worked all day preparing it.  Didn&#39;t change a thing.  Next time I will try the advice to serve with cornbread.,2,1,neutral

"This soup is amazing and super easy! I suggest prepping/cutting everything first and then begin the cooking. I made it my own by using 2 stalks of fresh celery instead of celery seed, adding some butter at the end, using fresh sharp cheddar instead of velveeta, added fresh garlic, and added the onion to the cooking bacon about 5 minutes in, cooking for a while longer, then draining to really add a deep flavor. I also sprinkled with paprika at the end- amazing!",2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve made this twice now. The first time according to recipe but used real WI cheese. Don&#39;t do celery because my daughter doesn&#39;t like it. The second time, I added more hamburger, a bit of minced garlic and a lot more grated sharp cheddar. We love it!",2,2,positive

I cut my grapes in half and put the brown sugar and nuts in the mixture.  I reduced the white sugar and the vanilla to my personal taste.   I only used about 2 lbs of grapes also.  You can do anything you want to this recipe and it&#39;s still going to be fabulous.   Great recipe.,2,2,positive

The horseradish was not a great compliment to these sandwiches. At all !! All the 5 star ratings fooled me. The horseradish taste like how it sound. It has a very strong taste and is spicy.

"My family loves this recipe. I make it regularly (every couple of weeks) and I get no complaints. In fact, I usually double the recipe because my roommate wants plenty of leftovers. I accidentally added the taco seasoning in towards the end one time and it didn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference. It was just slightly less flavorful but it was still good. I usually add seasonings to the ground beef, as I fry it, and I put different beans in it but that&#39;s it. It comes out delicious every time.",2,2,positive
"It&#39;s a wonderful pie.  If you don&#39;t want to make it (and miss out on a delicious, light dessert), simply because it doesn&#39;t use actual key limes, then don&#39;t make it.  But if you do, you&#39;re in for a real treat!!!  By the way, the color doesn&#39;t affect the taste.",2,2,positive

For those that had an overwhelming thyme taste use dried thyme LEAVES .....NOT ground thyme. Fresh thyme works best in my opinion..... especially if you can find lemon thyme. (It is easy to grow too. Best in 12x12 x12  inches deep pots and potting soil. Use started  small plants rather than seeds. So easy and cheaper in the long runI like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well. The only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand. I save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer. ,2,2,positive

This cake sounds wonderful will be trying it soon.i wouldn&#39;t think the shortening would make the frosting not taste good because a lot  of butter creams are half shortening half butter as in decorating cakes and reading the frosting recipe I would think either sugar would work I do know cheap shortening does not work as well and you don&#39;t want it to be more than a couple of months old.  But as others have said regarding frosting you really need to beat it good You can almost burn up a hand mixer trying to beat it sometimes. Thanks for sharing,2,0,negative
These muffins are moist but WAY too sweet. Other recipes I used require less sugar and no vanilla. I tried this anyway and it’s more like a cupcake than muffin.,1,1,neutral

I don&#39;t care if this is traditional Italian lasagna or not. What is important to me is that it tastes good. This looks like my long lost recipe for lasagna that I made in the 70&#39;s. I got it off a box of pasta. I am so glad to have found it again. I can&#39;t wait to make it.,2,2,positive
"I made this soup last night and it was so amazing I am sharing it with everyone I know. I made a few changes due to lack of reading the recipe fully. I used pork Italian sausage instead of turkey and let it brown really well. I omitted both peppers, red pepper because my little tongue doesn&#39;t do well with spice and black because I failed to see it when I read the recipe. I used dried basil because my market was out of fresh. Other than that I made it exactly as the recipe reads, even with the water, which did not dilute the flavor at all. I will make this over and over again, I cannot express how good it was.",2,2,positive
"Great meatloaf recipe, the sage gives a special touch.  I love the sauce on the side to use as much as desired.",2,2,positive
This was a big hit when i made it for a family gathering.  love the garlic/basil/tomato topping.  will definatly make it again and again,0,2,positive
I don&#39;t  give 5 stars very often. But my husband and I really did like this a lot. My teenage boys thought it was fine but they don&#39;t like Mexican food that much. I used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section. Traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has WAY too much salt. I also didn&#39;t add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested. The salt flavor was perfect. My husband also bought the HUGE tortillas so I still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla. I used 7 tortillas but they I cut about 1/3 off of them. I put in a little over 1/2 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top. We loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top. I wish I put avocado on top too. The flavor was great. There was a ton of sauce and we love sauce. Great meal.,2,2,positive

"My family loves these!  I always make a double batch for parties and potlucks.  One batch just as the recipe says.  The other batch I skip the horseradish and put a tiny smear of apricot, peach or marmalade jam on the bottom bun.  Leave out the onion in the butter sauce topper and use sesame seeds to differentiate between the two versions.  Both are huge hits!  Be sure to cut the ham and cheese to &#34;roll size&#34; before you put them together as it mskes them so much easier to cut for serving after they&#39;re baked.  Some vidros on the internet call for jyst laying large whole slices of ham overlapping on the bottom buns.  But then there&#39;s a huge mess when you try to cut them apart after baking. Avoid it by having the ham and cheese fit on the individual buns to start with!",2,2,positive
This was a wonderful and quick meal!  Other than reducing the onion to 1/2 to suit my families tastes I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  I&#39;ll certainly be making this one again.,2,2,positive

Then after boiling potatoes in chicken broth, removed a cup of potatoes and mashed them.  Returned to pot, added a little cream.  and had a deliciously thickened soup.  Oh and I never use cheese.  It’s not needed if you season your potatoes properly.",1,2,positive
My family really liked this chowder. It is easy to make and very versatile. I’ve made this twice. The first time I made as directed. It was pretty good but I needed a little more flavor. The second time I deglazed the sautéed veggies with 2 Tb white wine before adding the broth and I used Chicken bone broth instead oF bouillon. I also added a bay leaf and 1 tsp of old bay seasoning in addition to the other seasonings. I added 1/4 cup of vermouth along with the half and half. The chowder was amazing.,2,2,positive

"So good!!  I saved myself a pan though in the directions - after I transferred the cooked ground beef (I used a full pound and it was perfect) to a plate, I melted all of the butter called for in the same pan, sauteed the onions, carrots and celery and then sprinkled the flour over top after the veggies had softened.  I mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth.  It smelled so good while it was cooking!!  Once the potatoes were cooked through, I added in the milk and I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta, it is what I had on hand.  I also left out the basil and the sour cream and I am glad I did - my whole family loved this and I will definitely be making it again!  It came together so fast, a very hearty soup and so easy to make!  Even without my changes, this would&#39;ve been delicious, but I love how easy it is to alter it to your own tastes, you can&#39;t go wrong with this recipe.",2,2,positive

This is a perfect recipe for feeding a crowd. It makes a huge bowl of wonderfulness * I did spruce mine up a wee bit  by adding some extra spices * Everyone really enjoyed this recipe.Janie,2,2,positive
My family ABSOLUTELY loves this dish.  Doubled up on the recipe and made 2 trays as I have a home with 4 hungry males.  They love this &#34;Can&#39;t go wrong dish&#34;.  Easy and a great comfort food dish.  Highly recommend.  You won&#39;t be disappointed.  A keeper!!  &#34;Add a side salad and garlic bread and you have a home run,2,2,positive
"Excellent recipe!  I used half coconut oil and half butter, coconut pudding and half vanilla, half coconut extract!  Large pecan chunks and not all the choc chips!  To die for!",2,2,positive

This will be my staple.  Absolutely delicious.  I live cauliflower soup.  This is my favorite.,2,2,positive
"I made this for a mercy meal, and it disappeared almost at once.  Easy to make, for sure.  I used spinach and cheese ravioli, and instead of a jar of sauce, I used my own roasted veggie sauce.  Definitely a keeper!",2,2,positive
"This was my first time making potato soup.   What a great recipe! I had smoked sausage in the freezer, so I used that instead of bacon. Gave the soup a smoky nice flavor.  I had extras so I froze some and reheated later and it was just as good.  This is a winner.",2,2,positive
"Fixed this just as recipe stated, but it was missing something.  It tasted fine but just wasn&#39;t quite there.  Did some research and added a stick of butter.....made all the difference.  Now it is a great recipe for me!!",2,2,positive
"I love to bake, but I had never made banana bread until Thanksgiving of 2010. It turned out awful. It wasn&#39;t sweet enough or have enough banana flavor to suit me. I didn&#39;t give up, I saw this recipe on your website and tried it. It is magnificent! My family loved it so much they wanted loafs for their Christmas gifts. I pretty much have to make it about every week now. My co-workers love it. My friends at church love it. It is truly the best ever banana bread, and easy to make. Thanks for publishing this recipe!! Kristine from Anthony, Kansas",2,0,negative
"This recipe was a success :) I made a few changes- I didn&#39;t use red peppers because I had none, instead I threw in a can of those diced green chiles, gave it a nice flavor. Also, added two tablespoons of ricotta in with the sauce. Also, used a tiny bit more chicken than called for and to be honest I could have gone with even more chicken in retrospect! I would easily use 2lbs instead of 1 next time!",2,2,positive
I made this during the holidays and it was delicious. I am making it again for breakfast tomorrow. I highly recommend trying this dish.,0,2,positive

"Made a huge pot of this soup for Christmas Bunco with the girls.  At someone&#39;s suggestion, I cooked it a day ahead to let the flavors blend overnight.  I used Italian sausage (like hamburger) from the meat department.  I too omitted the water and added extra chicken broth.  I&#39;m not  fan of spinach so I used escarole lettuce instead.  It   turned  bright green and with the ITALIAN tomatoes I used, the soup had colors of red and green and really looked festive.  Oh and I used whole wheat tortellini.  I served it with the Onion Swiss Cheese Bread Ring and that heavenly Marinated Olive and Cheese Ring.  Everyone raved about the meal!  We had Christmas cookies for dessert.",2,2,positive

"This sweet salad drew raves at my Easter dinner...even though I forgot to add the brown sugar and pecans at the end. I add those to my leftovers and I really loved the added texture from the pecans. The recipe makes a large amount, making it perfect for a potluck. I halved the recipe for a my smaller group and still had some left for the next day.",2,2,positive
"Moist, Delicious,and Easy!  Made per recipe except left out the nuts and raisins.   Loved it!",2,2,positive
This is my go to recipe I am a novice bread baker and was a bit nervous if this recipe would work out. I am glad I did it&#39;s a hit every time the only thing I would like to share is the first time the bread lost moisture and so was a bit hard but then a friend told me to put a tray with water on the bottom rack to create a steam oven I am glad I got this tip the bread comes out moist on the inside and crusty on the outside!,2,2,positive
"I thought this cake was good but not really anything to rave about. If I ever make it again, I will probably make a frosting for it, poke holes into it for pudding, or cut it up to be used in some other sort of dessert.",2,1,neutral

"I&#39;m not a big fan of pork chops.  Every recipe I&#39;ve ever tried to make turned out dry and flavorless.  I was shocked at how good this was.  I followed the directions exactly and used loin chops.  Besides the long cook time, it&#39;s relatively easy to prepare and doesn&#39;t have any crazy ingredients.  My husband loved it too.  For potatoes without cheese, they were very flavorful.  We did add the paprika and (dried not fresh) parsley at the end.  Next time I make it I am going to try breading the pork chops in Italian bread crumbs because they were good but I thought there was room for more flavor.",2,2,positive
This is excellent.  I used macaroni noodles instead of penne and skipped the blender step.,2,2,positive
"I loved all the garlic in the sauce. My family said that this was their favorite enchilada recipe, surprising because I rarely use ground beef in my Mexican food recipes.  Listed sodium content is so high, I believe to be a typo. I still would use reduced sodium canned ingredients and not add the additional salt.",2,2,positive

I always bake  banana bread  and its  recipe is fool proof.I tried this recipe last night and I am sorry to say it was not a very good one ..it took 2 hours and still it was soggy.. So maybe  if we put less buttermilk in it result  might be different.. I like the taste of it tough. Nasira Mansoor,0,0,negative
I used a bag of brocolli coleslaw this time and it worked just as well. Very versatile dressing,2,2,positive
"I made this today and thought it was just okay untill I added the sour cream.  Then it was really good.  Next time I will saute some celery, onions and carrots and add them when I add the chicken.  Yummy!",2,2,positive
I really enjoyed this recipe. I read the comments prior to making and I added more garlic and seasoning (did not add extra salt or soy sauce) and I thought it was quite delicious! My meat and potatoes boyfriend really liked it too! I think this recipe is a keeper and I look forward to making it again and trying different veggie combinations with it.,2,2,positive

"Pretty good. I think it needs a little more seasoning, like S/P but overall, it is a very tasty recipe and one I will make again. I think buckey&#39;s suggestion to brown chops, remove and make gravy in the same pan is a good suggestion. All the flavor is in the bottom of the pan. Mine were done in less than an hour.",2,2,positive

"I don&#39;t know how many meatloafs I&#39;ve made over the years, or how many different versions I&#39;ve tried, but this is my very favorite. I make a couple of changes, though. I use 2 pounds of ground beef (or meatloaf mix; that&#39;s good, too). Otherwise, it turns out too &#34;loose&#34; for our taste. I grate the onion instead of chopping it. That way, its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf. And finally, instead of one free-form loaf in the middle of my 13&#34; x 9&#34; pyrex pan, I make two. That way, there&#39;s more surface to be covered with the sauce, and we just like it better that way. Leftovers make awesome sandwiches, too!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Michelle Beran!",2,2,positive
To answer the last question...yes it is 4 and 1/2 tsp. This is a super recipe! Always yummy. Chooclate and Peanut butter. You can&#39;t got wrong! Easy and great to eat!,2,2,positive

Big, BIG hit at my house!!",2,2,positive
This is the BEST pumpkin loaf ever!  So moist and flavourful.  A keeper for sure.,2,2,positive

"This soup is wonderful, full of flavor, and surprisingly simple.   I made a couple small adjustments to the original recipe, which are as follows:   I doubled the amount of mushrooms to 1 pound using a mixed variety of mushrooms and I used a large onion (chopped).   Otherwise, everything else was as written.   I like a lot of mushrooms in mushroom soup and 1/2 pound was not nearly enough.",2,2,positive
"I used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and it worked great! Also, I omited the cheddar cheese and it was still delicious.",2,2,positive
This is my go to apple pie recipe. So easy and so delicious.  Love it!,2,2,positive
"We really liked this recipe and the only change I made was adding 3rd can of beans (after reading the other reviews). Next time I make this chili I will decrease the amount of sour cream, and I will keep the pan on the stove after adding the sour cream &amp; heavy whipping cream - otherwise it cools the dish to lukewarm. This is a unique and flavorful meal.",2,2,positive
Wonderful recipe!  The technique is the secret.  Leave out items you don&#39;t have on hand or you know you don&#39;t like or sub with something similar.  The recipe still produces a great dish!,2,2,positive

"These are simple to make, and tasty for a treat or quick breakfast. What I like most about this recipe is how easy it is to jazz up.  I add chopped walnuts, or chocolate chips to it, sometimes a dash of almond extract instead of vanilla.  This is my go-to recipe to use up ripened bananas. It&#39;s quick and my family scarfs them down in no time.",2,2,positive
"I used lime juice instead of lemon, I just like it better, and I marinated whole thinly sliced chicken breasts for four hours.  It was fantastic! This is my new, go to chicken  fajita recipe.",2,2,positive
This is my go-to cake now. Everyone that I have served it to raved about this cake. I use my favorite Lavazza coffee for the brewed coffee. I substitute canned evaporated milk for the whole milk. My favorite frosting is a peanut butter frosting and I use it with this cake. I put a few piped swirls of frosting on top and top each swirl with a Reeses peanut butter cup.,2,2,positive

"This was super easy and really delicious. I didn&#39;t have fresh mushrooms so I used two small cans. I wasn&#39;t sure about that because we love fresh mushrooms, but when they were sauteed in butter and added to the recipe, they were great. My husband asked me to add more cheese and more green onion the next time. When we heated it for leftovers I would add a handful of shredded cheese on the chicken.  I&#39;ll also try chicken tenderloins, as I almost always have them on hand. Just have to watch the cooking time. Fabulous! Good enough for a company dinner.",2,2,positive

"Made for our family of 4, two kids and two adults. We are garlic lovers, so this recipe stood out to me. Everyone ate it, although nobody was rushing to get a second helping. I thought the sauce was tasty and the dish overall was a solid recipe. That said, for the time it took to put together, I didnt think it was really worth it. (I made on a weeknight and dinner was served later than usual for the time it took to compose.) I likely wouldnt make again.",2,2,positive
"Fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  One small thing I would change is to omit the 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar in the pudding layer.  It&#39;s plenty sweet already.For the reviewer whose pudding layer didn&#39;t set up, don&#39;t forget to let the pudding stand until soft-set.

"Very good flavor but a bit heavy on the onion. In following the recipe exactly, I felt there was too much sauce, which can easily be remedied by adding another potato or two to soak up more of the sauce.

That differentiates it from Italian lasagna, but I have always found that rather than disparage a recipe because of your purist tastes, or dismissing it out of hand, try it.  Different people like different things.  I quite like both this version and the ones made in Italian kitchens.  You will find differences in recipes from your own Mario and Giada, and I&#39;m not sure I would rank either of them among the world class of chefs that you seem to suggest they are, Martin.

I made it with store bought pie dough still was delicious and easy love it thank you,2,2,positive
"This is a full-bodied soup that makes a great meal, with a side of crusty bread. I used the hot Italian turkey sausage because we like spicy food. There was mild, not overpowering heat. The preparation was quick and easy. The result is a delicious homemade soup.",2,2,positive

"I am not normally a huge fan of chicken pot pie; however I had lots of Thanksgiving leftovers to use, so I thought I would try one. Well, boy and I glad I did! I am now a believer! This is the BEST chicken (or turkey!) pot pie I have ever eaten! Even my husband raved! I did leave out the corn, and probably lowered the amount of thyme (my shaker bottle wouldn&#39;t let me take the lid off, so I just poured a couple of shakes worth in the sauce). This recipe halves well, as I wasn&#39;t about to make 2 pot pies (see first comment about not liking pot pie). I will definitely make the full recipe next time and freeze one! Thanks for the amazing recipe!!",2,2,positive

Excellent recipe.  I altered the veggies that I used but followed the rest of the recipe.  The creamy roux in this thing is on point.  So delicious.  I make one pie using the creamy mixture and then freeze the creamy mixture for a future pie.  It&#39;s perfect.  Love it!!!,2,2,positive
"This was a huge hit with my family (even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie)!  It took some time to prep, but it was well worth the effort.  I love freezer cooking so having a pie for the freezer was a definite plus! I used deep dish pie crusts and this made 2 very full pies.  Delicious!",2,2,positive

"This was soooo unbelievably good! I only made a half recipe to try the first time, and I didn&#39;t have shrimp, but it was so good anyways, the flavor was perfect, not too spicy. And of course being able to throw it all in the slow cooker is such a bonus! I use mine as often as I can to make life easier.",2,2,positive

"I have made this several times and my wife and I love it. Recently my wife is on a special diet and has lost a lot of weight. Because of this diet, she cannot use crackers or breadcrumbs. Her weight loss coach told her to use pork rinds/Chicharones as a binder. I used that and it did not affect the taste at all. She also cannot use the topping, so she has special ketchup that her coach told her to use.",2,2,positive
Awesome white chili.  My husband was skeptical since chili is one of his favorite foods.  He loved it!  It is now a favorite in our house.,2,2,positive

Ha ha.",2,2,positive
"They are ok.  Not &#34;to-die-for&#34;.  Easy enough that I may make again, but other desserts outshine these in taste...a little heavy on the almond extract.  Turn out well if prepared exactly as directions say, but need to bake longer in the oven.",1,1,neutral

good quality recipe and bread :) thank you.,2,2,positive
"I&#39;ve tried lots of recipes, this was the first that came close to the one my mother always made . I used crunchy peanut butter and added some vanilla and a pinch of salt. I greased the foil with spray and added the butter to the milk and sugar mixture. So glad this recipe doesn&#39;t need a candy thermometer. Prep your ingredients first so you can mix quickly.",2,2,positive

I only make half because there&#39;s just the two of us, but this is the only pot pie I ever make because it&#39;s easy, doesn&#39;t use canned soup, and taste excellent!  If you don&#39;t have exactly what&#39;s in the recipe, you can substitute anything your heart desires and it&#39;s always good.

"I love Mexican food. This looked so good but tasted sooooo disappointing! I wondered about not adding an entire package of taco seasoning, should have went ahead and added the whole thing. The flour tortillas were a mistake too....just mush and blah. It really didn’t taste like an enchilada casserole at all. It had potential but just a huge fail taste wise.",0,1,neutral

"Based on previous reviews that it was too soupy, cut the chicken broth to 2 cups.  Also substituted 1 10 oz can Ro-Tel original plus 1/2 of 8 oz can tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes.  Used rotisserie chicken instead of turkey and replaced the yellow pepper with celery.  Garnished with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips.  Didn&#39;t really taste the pumpkin as much as it just gave it a wonderful earthy taste.  The whole family loved it!",2,2,positive

The cake was moist and delicious. The only problems I had was that it took a much longer time to cook because I used one rectangular pan and I had issues getting the lumps of shortening out of the frosting. The cake was delicious and you didn&#39;t notice the lumps when the frosting was on the cake so overall amazing! Will make again,2,2,positive

"This recipe was GREAT!! The only change I made was halving the lemon juice and using chicken broth for the other half so it wouldn&#39;t be so lemony.  I also added fresh basil in addition to the fresh parsley. I did broil it, which I agree added a nice touch!!  My family is very picky and they all agree this one is a keeper!",2,2,positive

I&#39;m rarely disappointed, and a search today led me to this one - which I will keep. It is amazing. Will top some pieces with some raspberries that I froze at the end of the season last year (the canes are already getting ready to produce a new crop) and we will enjoy it this evening.  Thank you.",2,2,positive
Just finished eating my first attempt at this recipe and it was great! Did make a couple of changes....added 4 chopped onions and one clove of minced garlic. Didn&#39;t have clam juice so used 1/2 of clamato juice and increased chicken broth to 1 cup. We are looking forward to leftover tomorrow!,2,2,positive

"Very good recipe! I made a couple modifications thoughI didn&#39;t add any mushrooms,I didn&#39;t use any butter since the beef had enough fat,I used a stick blender on the soup before I added the ground beef,I didn&#39;t use any flour to thicken the soup as the potatoes thickened it enough.And finally, I added a little pickle juice to the soup.That really added something that was missing.",2,2,positive

Used beef stock, Marinara sauce, better than boullion beef base &amp; diced tomatoes with jalapenos, plus an additional cup of peppers. Brown rice into the bowl when serving, because its what I had on hand.  A nice sprinkle of Parmesan cheese is a must...it isn&#39;t stuffed peppers without the cheese.  My family &amp; neighbors enjoyed this so much..I may never make traditional stuffed peppers again.  Thank you Hosses for the keeper recipe.Haha..well look at that, making it again after a storm almost three years exactly to the date.  Yummo.  House smells crazy good.",2,2,positive

"Such a easy, quick, delicious soup. Didn&#39;t have any tortellini, so I used cheese ravioli. My husband loved it!",2,2,positive
"I&#39;m giving this five stars, tho I did have to  make some substitutions based on what I had on hand. I used some leftover beef roast, about 2/3 bag of frozen mixed veg medley, almost a whole jar of turkey gravy with some generous splashes of Worcestershire sauce, some leftover mash, and some crunched up tater tots (to make up for my small amount of mash). I layered on some processed cheese, you know, the kind that comes in a 2# loaf, and just left it to bubble away. My husband declared it &#34;some really good comfort food&#34;, which was perfect after the crummy, rainy day we had.  So, please forgive me, reviewer purists out there. For everyone else, I&#39;ll just say this recipe is very forgiving. It&#39;s hard to go too wrong with a combo of beef, veggies and potatoes, especially when you only have to wash one pan. Oh, and I didn&#39;t add the sour cream, because I knew, with only the two of us, there would be leftovers and I didn&#39;t know how that would hold up.",2,2,positive
"I have made this bread a few times and it is a definite favorite! I even like to sprinkle some coarse sugar on top of the glaze for a little crunch.

"I made this pie for St Patrick&#39;s Day. As lime is not my favorite, I will make it only for special occasions like St. Patrick&#39;s Day, but it was quick and easy. However, I found that all the jello did not get completely &#39;folded in&#39; as there were a few chewy pieces of the jello spread throughout the pie. I also found that the crust apparently absorbed some liquid from the filling as it was a little softer than I would have liked. Maybe that was because I used Dream Whip instead of Cool Whip which I did not have on hand and no time to go out and purchase some.",2,1,neutral
This was delicious…. Lots of layers with the flavors - beginning withe the bacon - to the potatoes to the onions to the clams…. Perfect for a cold night.  Raves from everyone who ate it..  Ready for me to make again.,2,2,positive

I made the caramelized onions (but omitted the poppy seeds) and put them ON the sandwich, on top of the cheese. I wrapped the sandwiches in foil and baked them for 30 minutes. My husband is not a big ham eater and he said these were great; he loved the flavors together. This will be a recipe I&#39;ll make again and again.",2,2,positive

I disagree with most of the people on here about this recipe being fast and easy.  I started it at 5 and by the time I was done with all the chopping it was 7.  Definitely a weekend meal.,2,2,positive

Marinated for about 2hrs. I love cooking in cast iron and I use a counter top hot place that I can adjust the temperature to precise numbers. I used 375 degrees. The flavors were absolutely wonderful. My Husband said that was the best Fajita he has ever had. Thanks for this fantastic recipe.",2,2,positive
me and my husband really liked it. I didn&#39;t have any green onions but it turned out really well. I used about a cup of broth to start out with and it boiled down good. I loved the cheese on top and probably put more than called for! The mushrooms were fantastic!,2,2,positive

"Absolutely love this and so easy to make! My grocery store only had hot turkey sausage, so I opted instead for the precooked Jimmie Dean sausage crumbles. The textures and flavors just go together so well!",2,2,positive
"This recipe was super easy to make and my whole family loved it, including my picky 4 and 6 year old girls. Glad I found this. Will definitely add to my rotation of meals. I typically have all these ingredients on hand.",2,2,positive
"this is a good starter recipe,as there is no taste as is. I did everything in the recipe but added 1 T. zesty italian seasoning,1 tsp. basil,1 tsp. thyme,2 tsp. pesto, mushroom&#39;s, less than a 1/4 c. each black and green olives. a good splash of white wine and balsamic vinegar. i would use regular lasagna noodles, run them under hot water to form to pan,don&#39;t boil them. as the no cook get&#39;s to mushy and looses their form. It would be great for a work pot luck,where you want to keep it warm. It makes a big batch and not recommended 4 two people as you have to keep it in the crock to keep it&#39;s form,in the refrigerator.",2,2,positive
Great recipe ?? we used carb master yogurt to cut the carbs ? my daughter is a type 1 diabetic so we gotta watch those ?? anybody knocking this recipe or anything sugar free !!! Some people aren&#39;t as fortunate or have no choice with certain things ???? my daughter can still consume sugars etc and to be honest white bread would spike her more then a snicker bar lol contrary to belief...,2,0,negative
"Pretty good, but make sure to use a 12&#34; skillet.  I also recommend changing the last step. I used a cast iron skillet, &amp; after adding the cheese, I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes.",2,2,positive
"I made this for my sister and brother in law&#39;s birthday. He likes anything that&#39;s peanut butter and chocolate! I found it very easy to make. It was a little tricky getting the Oreos on the bottom. I think next time I would omit the butter and just sprinkle them in the pan. I used fat free cream cheese and light cool whip, still came out great! My brother in law thought it was very rich but I thought it was perfect.",2,2,positive
"Just love this receipe! Dont over stir, stir just untilmoistened. Question Tab1922 said they used blueberries. anybodyelse use blueberries too? If so, about how many blueberriesdid you use and think frozen blueberries would be ok??Thanks everyone for you help with this.",2,0,negative
I absolutely loved this recipe and so did my husband. It was especially tasty for leftovers the next day. I will definitely make this again!,2,2,positive
"This is really good as is, but I did make a couple of tweaks to suit my palate the second time around. Now I use a package and a half of cole slaw mix; I think it&#39;s too wet otherwise. I reduce the sugar to 2 tbls and add 1 tbls vinegar and a little green onion. I didn&#39;t have celery salt the first time I made it, so I used 3/4 tsp celery seed and increased the seasoned salt to 1 tsp. It worked out well, so that&#39;s what I continue to do. I&#39;ll certainly never buy that jarred slaw dressing again; this is so simple to make and infinitely better.",2,2,positive
"Definitely not a keeper for our house.  Made exactly according to directions and our 2 year old pushed her bowl away saying “No, thank you! Yuck!”, the teenager tried two bites and decided on a sandwich, and the two adults ate it but said never again. Will stick to a traditional potato soup.",1,2,positive
Sorry..but I am not seeing where in the recipe the half.  N half is added and the amt that Martha is speaking about.,0,0,negative
"So easy and good!  I always add celery, carrots, onion and garlic, and last time I threw in some peas, too.  I use the sour cream if I have it on hand, but we don&#39;t miss it when I don&#39;t have it.",2,2,positive
My daughter helped me make this and she loved it.  Super easy to make without a complicated pie crust!!,2,2,positive
I made this for Thanksgiving and not only was it easy to make it was so good!  It was nice to serve something traditional with a twist.,2,2,positive
"Stop looking! This is the best oatmeal chocolate cookie recipe! Not only did it make a lot of cookies, each cookie looked great- baked for 10min then let them sit on cookie sheet. As a volunteer food editor for Taste of Home, friends and family expect great cookies from my kitchen, these cookies did not disappoint!",2,2,positive
Very good comfort food.,2,2,positive

I&#39;ve been making this recipe since it was first published. I make it into one meatloaf and bake for an hour ( I also reduce the amount of brown sugar to make the topping less sweet) I once suggested trying a different meatloaf recipe and my husband and daughter threatened to leave if I didn&#39;t make this one! ,2,2,positive
"THESE ARE AMAZING!!  I made them for our Christmas party this year and our guests raved over them.  They will definitely become a standard on our party menu!  I doubled the recipe and mistakenly didn&#39;t double the sauce, but it made so much, it was a happy accident!  I wouldn&#39;t have wanted double the amount of sauce.  Thank you for a FABULOUS recipe!",2,2,positive
It was alright.  My husband did not really like it but he liked that it kept him full for a long time.,1,1,neutral
"I really can&#39;t get over this bread. I made 2 batches every week. I usually substitute 1 1/2 cups of AP flour with whole wheat. It&#39;s just lovely. Actually, I just made some except after letting it rise, I took one loaf worth,  kneaded in about 1c. raisins, then rolled it out rubbed on some butter and sprinkled on cinnamon sugar (1 1/2 tbspn cinnamon, 3tbspn brown sugar), and rolled it up, let it rise and baked like the recipe says, and ohmygoodness. Best raisin bread I have ever had. Just came out of the oven. mmmmm",2,2,positive
"We make this cake for my daughter&#39;s birthday on New Year day because I didn&#39;t have a box mix. This is the best chocolate cake we have ever had, better then any box or bakery cake. The frosting is perfect and not to sweet. I made a double batch of frosting and used all of it on a two layer cake.",2,2,positive
I made a double batch and my husband and I loved it!,2,2,positive

"This is a great recipe, bulletproof for swaps and adds.  Not to be &#34;that guy&#34; but I swapped half the flour for almond flour and used splenda instead of sugar (use half the amount of splenda that the recipe calls for or you&#39;ll be sorry...).  Then I added walnuts and cranberries and a scoop of PB2.",2,2,positive
"I thought this was an awesome recipe,  interesting and quite tasty.  I did increase the meat to 1 1/2 pounds, and used a marinara sauce.  Thanks for sharing.",2,2,positive
"I never made an apple pie before so this was my first attempt.  Everybody loved it!  In fact, I&#39;ve made this 4 times in just 2 weeks.",2,2,positive
Haven&#39;t made this pie yet but was just wondering if anyone has tried making this with Salted Caramel because they were out of the Smuckers caramel topping at the store. Please Help!!!! Just want to make sure I won&#39;t ruin it.,0,1,neutral
"Made this for my son&#39;s soccer team, and again for a dinner party with my husband&#39;s work colleagues, and both times I received rave reviews for this dish.  Even my picky 9-year old loved this lasagna. This will be my go-to recipe for lasagna!",2,2,positive
Too sweet for me.  Not enough peanut butter taste.,1,1,neutral
"Next time I&#39;ll leave out the Italian dressing - it gave it a sweetness that I felt was out of place. And I&#39;ll use more beef and less onion. Between the salsa and the whole onion... it was just about too much. but in general, a good recipe!",2,2,positive
"Too salty, I even omitted the pre salting,  lacked substance...waste of my good zucchini!",0,0,negative
The best banana muffins ever!  I froze overripe bananas first  (to save them from going bad) and barely mixed the batter. How can I send a picture?,2,2,positive
"I have enjoyed this recipe, as written and it was delicious.  I have now added my own additions and use hot sausage in place of the beef.  I have also used pizza sauce to make it more like pizza and added traditional pizza toppings.  Great taste anyway you decide to make it and it is a great recipe for those that are doing keto or low carb diets.",2,2,positive
"Burnt the first three dozen.  The cookied didn&#39;t spread as they baked, so I ended up with burnt little balls.  Flattened out the last batch a bit and they baked perfectly.",2,2,positive
"Delicious!  I loved all the vegetables, and the provolone cheese was the perfect amount and flavor.  Couldn&#39;t find green onions at the grocery, so I left those out, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as stated.",2,2,positive
i made this for a dinner party  and served it in sip &#39;n style bowls I ordered on amazon.It was perfect.,2,2,positive
This is now my go-to banana muffin recipe.  I sometimes add 1C of blueberries or 1C diced strawberries.  I always add about 1/2C chopped walnuts or pecans.  I make 18 instead of 12 muffins because of the additions and I found the original recipe to be just too much for only 12 muffins.  Everybody loves these muffins.  YEEEAAA!!!,2,2,positive
"Delicious !! I loved it because it skips the tomatoes which I&#39;m tired of lately every quick dish is buried in tomato sauce.Had to improvise, only had 1 can of chilies, added a tsp of chipotle to make up for it.1 half breast wasn&#39;t a pound 2 was a little over. The extra bit of meat was a bonus.Don&#39;t always have heavy cream on hand, had to leave it out but used a bit of whole milk.Served it with crispy garlic Texas Toast.This is worth expanding for a crowd. It&#39;s a nice change from red chili that seems to be the rage.",2,2,positive
This is so simple and so good! Had an abundance of zucchini from the garden and this is one of our favorite ways to eat zucchini. The only change I made is that sometimes I add slices of pepperoni before adding the cheese topping. A winner!,2,2,positive
Amazing soup!! I dont even like green peppers and I LOVED this! I like my soups more hearty like a stew so I omitted some of the water and I added extra green peppers! I also tried doubling the recipe except the beef because I think 2 pounds is a lot and it turned out fantastic!! Yum!,2,2,positive
Such an amazing recipe!! Just made it and my mom and dad loved it and so did I!  Very simple... a little lengthy process but totally worth it!,2,2,positive
"The only thing I changed was half the sugar, I don&#39;t like sweet meat.    YUM!!",2,2,positive
"I halved the recipe because it&#39;s just my husband and myself.  Wished now, after tasting it, that I would have made the full one. We will have leftovers for breakfast tomorrow morning. ",2,2,positive
Excellent! Easy and very flavorful. I cut back on lemon juice as I am not a fan. I used garlic flavored seasoned bread crumbs as I love garlic. I paired with brown rice made with chicken broth but I can see if you were using pasta you would need to double the sauce. Will definitely make again!,2,2,positive
"It has become a family favorite. i always make it on a glass mold so, 325 has worked fine with me.",2,2,positive
This was pretty bland. I had added 2 diced chicken breasts and extra black pepper &amp; even some Korean chili powder but that was not enough. What really helped was sprinkling some green onions over the top of the soup after serving.,1,1,neutral
Phenomenal recipe.  After reading other baker&#39;s reviews I increased my ginger to 1.5 tablespoons and increased cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Fearing a spread I added 1/4 cup oat flour for chewiness and spread prevention.  Bingo!!!Perfection!  Thank you fellow bakers for the helpful tips.,0,2,positive
Very easy to make and they were quite a hit!!,2,2,positive
I have been carrying this recipe around since I found it in an issue of the Taste of Home Magazine that is dated 1993. I have shared it with everyone that has asked for a Moist Chocolate Cake. And the Icing Recipe that is with this cake is Excellent! It is NOT sweet at all. You can actually eat the whole piece of cake without scraping the icing off due to heavy sweetness. I truely believe that every cook out there should have a copy of this recipe for it is the BEST.Barb Smith,2,2,positive
"Have made this recipe about 4 times already in the past few months, its a family favorite! Followed the recipe exactly and it has been perfect. Like comfort food in a soup!",2,2,positive
"What a wonderful cake!  Easy to make and just delicious!  The addition of fresh strawberries in the batter added so much fresh flavor, and the strawberry buttercream frosting is just wonderful.  This cake is moist, delicious and packed with strawberry goodness.  Its a perfect warm weather dessert when strawberries are at their peak and something I will definitely make again and again!",2,2,positive
"Fabulous!!! I followed your recipe exactly, except doubled and added a can of rotel and one can of tomato sauce. Soooo delicious, and easy! Thank you!!",2,2,positive
I made this for Saturday dinner and my son and I like it.  I substituted sausage for bacon.  The next time I think I might add green pepper.  Definitely a keeper.,2,2,positive
"This was so good! Unfortunately, I can&#39;t leave well enough alone :(  Had to add pepperoni and olives on top when the grandkids were here - used shredded chicken, bacon and alfredo sauce in (2) 8x8&#39;s for work. Endless possibilities for an wonderful base!!",2,2,positive
"Needs a little more caramel filling, but the taste is great and very good",2,2,positive
One of the best chili recipes! I make this every year in the Fall and Winter. Everyone I make it for ALWAYS ask for the recipe.,2,2,positive
"Loved this recipe!  I used olive oil instead of canola oil.  Instead of sugar I used about 2/3 c maple syrup.  Seemed a little soupy so I added an extra 1/2 cup GF flour.  My blend of GF flour is brown rice flour, potato starch and tapioca flour so I added 3/4 teaspoon xantham gum. Wasn&#39;t too sweet either.",2,2,positive
Confusing frosting recipe!  Cake turned out great but I used regular sugar for frosting and I think it should have been POWDERED SUGAR instead. It was gritty.  It did not specify.  Please correct.                  3 star,1,2,positive
"This recipe really is good! While it bakes, it smells so delicious that you just want to dive in before it is finished baking. For me 45 minutes was enough. The bread was not crumbly or dry. It was the perfect amount of moisture, and the flavor was great! I am very impressed since it is a GF recipe. Some do not turn out this well.",2,2,positive
I got the credit of  making a tasty cake,2,2,positive
This was wonderful.  My husband raved about it at work and had people request the recipe.,2,2,positive
"Lynn&#39;s recipe was fantastic! My whole family loved a new dish, which I feel doesn&#39;t happen that often :) I forgot the red or green pepper, but it still tasted great. I added a little drizzle of olive oil to the zucchini part just before layering on the meat sauce. Really really delish--and easy.",2,2,positive
This is my favorite pot pie recipe the only thing I change is the frozen veg I’m weird I prefer canned but tonight I still have fresh corn so I will use that but the best recipe seriously,2,2,positive
"I have been making this soup for years and years.  It is a family favorite and gets rave reviews from everyone who has had it!  Try it, you will LOVE it.",2,2,positive
"I thought this was a very good recipe. I substituted some sour cream for some of the water and doubled the recipe to use a full can of pumpkin. I substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar and reduced the sugar by 1/4 c. I made a large loaf and 15 standard muffins.To those who changed the recipe and then it didn&#39;t work out, cooking is chemistry--change the formula and you can get unexpected results, if you don&#39;t compensate.

A new fav in our house. I used only wheat flour and also added cinnamon and nutmegMy husband absolutely loves them..,2,2,positive
"This was a big hit. I made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe.  First of all my daughters do not care for green chilies, so I used only one can. I also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic. My daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture.  Secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro, I use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups; so in this case I doubled the amount of cilantro. Additionally I added a quarter cup of rice. My oldest doesn&#39;t like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice I used a 48 ounce box of broth. This gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved. I used precooked roasted chicken so I added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34;.  Lastly to make it healthier I swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. All of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter.",2,2,positive
Yes! Best ever potato soup!,2,2,positive
Will definately make these again. A big hit!,2,2,positive
Read the reviews and was a little nervous to make this. I added the 1/4 tsp of salt and I changed the vanilla to 2 Tablespoons. It turned out very good. It&#39;s a good &#34;base cake&#34;. Plenty of options came to mind after I tasted it.,2,2,positive
"I made these today - wow!!  The best muffin i have had in a long time. After reading the reviews, I thought a muffin is a muffin.  What could be so wonderful about these? I was wrong! These are wonderful.",2,2,positive
This was the perfect crock pot chili recipe for game day.  I doubled it and added a can of beans.  It was still a little on the soupy side so I will add more chicken next time.  It needs more than 3 1/2 hours to cook for the chicken and onions to get good and tender.  I would recommend 6 hours in the slow cooker.,2,2,positive
Tasty. It was easy to make. Make sure to rinse the potatoes. I can see adding things in it like mushrooms or peas etc.,2,2,positive
"These were great, not oily like most zucchini recipes.  For my cooking class, we used a giant zucchini, and scooped out the seeds.  We also cut the amount of cloves to 1/4 teaspoon and doubled the recipe which yielded 45 delicious cupcakes.  Don&#39;t skip the frosting -- it was almost like fudge --yum!!",2,2,positive
Yummy. Will make it again. Mom many years ago would make it. Did not last very long. Mom said that the potatoes tasted a lot better the next day. This is my go to recipe.,2,2,positive
"This recipe tasted great!  It was also really easy to make.  I did use 2 cups of the cheese instead of 1 because it just didn&#39;t seem like enough, even though that added a lot more calories.  Next time I might try saving the sour cream out and putting it on top.",2,2,positive

"Wonderful taste, very easy recipe. Did not change the recipe at all. This is my new favorite banana bread recipe. Thanks.",2,2,positive
We enjoyed this recipe as written the first few times I made it. Last time I added a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and it was even tastier. It adds flavor and makes a creamier gravy.,2,2,positive
"These are a favorite of my 9 year old son (I use less sugar for him, he still loves them!).",2,2,positive
Family enjoys these tasty sandwiches!  Only change for us it to use less Horseradish.  it was a little too strong for our taste. We use this when the family come often.,2,2,positive
"I love Mexican style meals better than my wife but she gave these five stars also. I complimented these with refried beans (recipe compliments of Ree Drummond), arroz rojo aka red rice (recipe compliments of Marcela Valladolid) and quacamole. For the two of us this was to much to eat for one meal but it was excellent the next day. Two tips: the refried beans freeze well for use at a later date, if you have plenty of left over quacamole smooth it out on top and gently add a thin layer of water, the next day pour the water off and you have quacamole that didn&#39;t turn brown.",2,2,positive
"I think the tortillas I used were a tad bigger than recommended.  They barely fit into my dish, but they sure were good and tasty.",2,2,positive
Really yummy!  Mine did take a lot longer to bake - maybe because I used the convection option on my oven.  But the bread turned out great!,2,2,positive
loved it - used hot italian sausage.,2,2,positive

I have sometimes added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the recipe with excellent results.",2,2,positive

"This was very good, but I&#39;m not sure what I think about the cream cheese...That part was not quite sweet enough when mixed with only pudding and no additional sugar.  Otherwise great!  I think it would be good with strawberries instead of pineapple to compliment the cream cheese.I used the recipe as a guideline, but made my own cake and pudding from scratch, and no fat-free or sugar-free stuff.  I also topped with toasted coconut instead of walnuts.We were not patient enough to wait for it to chill so it might be better cold!",2,2,positive
"I made these for company &amp; everyone loved them.  Only problem was the grocery store sold horseradish but not horseradish sauce. I found a recipe online to make up my own horseradish sauce, since using just horseradish would be too strong.",2,2,positive

"I made this yesterday for my birthday cake.  I used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water, and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  After adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin. I&#39;ve never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it.  I baked 2 layers on the top rack and 1 on the bottom rack.  The top rack cakes were ready at the 30 minute mark so I pulled them out.The cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle, so I moved it to the top rack and baked it another 7 or 8 minutes.  The top of that 3rd layer had a funny darkened pupil-in-an-eyeball sort of center appearance, probably from the jiggling it received when I moved it to the top rack, but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted.  I made my own frosting (a butter &amp; cocoa powder version) that I know is delicious, since some folks mentioned they didn&#39;t like the sour cream flavored icing much.  The cake had a nice dense, moist texture and a great not-too-chocolatey flavor.  It makes a huge cake; mine was 4&#34; tall when assembled, so be sure to cut thin slices!  I will save this to bake again- we shared a huge chunk with the neighbors and are still enjoying leftovers!",2,1,neutral

(and my Dad is very picky  nowadays) I used 2 pounds of meatloaf mix meat instead of only ground beef, cause beef is just so expensive, and it was wonderful! I also kicked up the spices a little with Montreal Steak Seasoning when browning meat and a little crushed red pepper. So Good!! And those of us who wanted added a little Texas Pete to soup when we ate (with grilled cheeses). Had plenty to freeze, too! Even better reheated!! Will be making A LOT!!",2,2,positive
Yum. I cut back a little on the sugar and it was still plenty sweet.,2,2,positive

"Very moist and tastes OK.  Not sure I will make it again though.  There is a strong flavor to the cake that I do not really like.  Also, I had to add vanilla to the frosting.  Otherwise, I didn&#39;t change anything.   Perhaps it will taste better tomorrow...some things are like that!  One thing I really liked about the recipe is that it is quick to make and I did not have to get out my big mixer.",2,1,neutral
"I haven&#39;t made this exact recipe but I&#39;m still giving it a thumbs up......I got this recipe from a friend and it wasn&#39;t exactly the same ---no caramelized onions or horseradish or w&#39;shire sauce, maybe she didn&#39;t like those things so left them out.  I don&#39;t think you can mess up this recipe !  I used regular h&#39;burger buns, mustard powder, no poppy seeds (didn&#39;t have any ) .  I made them in a 9x13 pan.  The men thought they were alittle sweet, but still devoured them !  my g&#39;kids just loved them and keep asking me to make them again !   This recipe is really pretty forgiving and versatile, for me it&#39;s a keeper. Now I want to try this version......Oh also they freezer great.....",2,2,positive

SUPER delicious. Will be making it again.  Did not use nuts and it was still yummy.  Super moist and full of flavor!Wondering if I can use blackberries  with this recipe.  Anyone tried iother fruits?,2,2,positive
I just used the crumb topping because I have a great recipe for apple pie.  This topping was delicious.  I can&#39;t wait to make it again.   Maybe today!,2,2,positive
Everytime I serve this to guests they want the recipe!  I bet we have this once a month for dinner.  I use Italian style chopped tomatoes and it gives it even more flavor.  Great recipe.,2,2,positive
"Does Taste of Home not publish negative reviews?  This cake was a disaster for me today.  I used 9-inch pans and the cake came out over the top and spilled into the oven.   I followed the recipe to the letter, but I think it should have been baked at 350 degrees rather than 325 and perhaps part of the batter should have been used for cupcakes as described if one used the 8-inch pans!  Too much batter for 9-inch pans.",0,0,negative
"I&#39;ve been making this recipe for the past year, it&#39;s absolutely delicious.  I usually freeze one of the two, which I love.  It&#39;s great knowing you have a meal ready in the freezer if needed.  This meal is perfect for the colder seasons.  I also appreciate that it&#39;s a recipe that you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand.  I love celery, so I&#39;ll saute celery with the onions and if I have green beans or anything else, I can make additions or adjustments with the veggie amounts.",2,2,positive
"Only used all purpose flour.  Made half the batch as is, then added blueberries to the remainder.  Delicious! Will make a double batch next time and freeze them.",2,2,positive

"If I was just reviewing the bars without the frosting, I would give this 5 stars. They are so good. I baked mine in a 15 x 10 pan per the recipe, and had to make extra frosting, as there was not enough to cover the top (even with a very thing layer). 6 oz. of cream cheese is a strange amount. I used the whole 8 oz. brick, and added the proportion of powdered sugar and milk needed to finish topping the bars. I wonder if there&#39;s a typo in the recipe? Should it be 6 oz. of cream cheese, or should it have been 16 oz? Would have been plenty of frosting (maybe too much) for a 9x13 using 6 oz, but not enough for the 15x10.",2,2,positive
"This recipe scared me at first!  However, I am a big fan of consistent five star reviews, so, I tried it.  Then, I saw the residual grease from the bacon and I was worried I&#39;d find a grease puddle at the top of the soup bowl.  I stuck with the recipe not changing a thing since it was the first time trying it.It was YUMMY!  Hearty, rich, flavorful!  Not dietary, but it was after Christmas and I used leftover ham!  Very good!",2,2,positive

Unfortunately the Vietnamese egg rolls my sister-in- law taught me how to make use a rice &#34;thread noodle&#34;, so that&#39;s what I thought this recipe was calling for. Pretty sure they&#39;re not the same. Still it has great flavor. But I am also thinking maybe a side of fried wonton would make it a 5 star.",2,2,positive

Also, with adding the milk, it&#39;s more like a cream gravy, and I prefer a rich traditional chicken gravy.  Not terrible, but won&#39;t be a keeper for our house.",1,2,positive

This is a great chocolate cake recipe.   I made it with cake flour because I didn&#39;t have any AP flour.    It turned out super, it was moist  but not heavy , just  light.   The flavors were well rounded but not too sweet and the texture  was super.   I believe the brown sugar and the sour cream really set it apart from any other chocolate cake I ever made.   This one was perfect.    I didn&#39;t perfect the frosting but the cake is definitely a keeper .",2,2,positive

Loved by all, even the pickiest eaters.",2,2,positive

This recipe was super easy (I see that as a theme!)  I followed the recipe closely except I used the frozen noodles that remind me of grandma&#39;s homemade noodles and it was really good with those!!  Next time I&#39;ll probably add carrots too because it lacks a little color.  I also used precooked turkey that I cubed up but my husband requested shredded chicken next time too so I&#39;ll try it again that way!!  Delicious!,2,2,positive

"This is tops in comfort food. I have to admit ,that the first time in my married life, I did not have tomato sauce on hand, so I used petite diced tomatoes I already had on hand. Ran them through the blender and it worked very well. These were even better (as many tomatoey recipes are) the next day as leftovers. Thanks so much. This is just what I was looking for.",2,2,positive
"I made this last night and it was excellent! The hubby said it was better than any restaurant. I made it as written except used olive oil, lemon and lime juice, and no red pepper flakes (should&#39;ve used them... needed a little kick). I charred up the peppers and onions in the broiler. Served with shredded mixed Mexican cheeses and sour cream. Delish!",2,2,positive
These cupcakes were great,2,2,positive
"This soup is so good! Pure comfort food! We like a little more meat, so I used a pound of hamburger and replaced the Velveeta with VT white cheddar. I was low on milk, so used a whole can of evaporated milk instead, and omitted the sour cream. It had the right thickness for our liking. This is now in our regular meal rotation.",2,2,positive
"I would definitely make this again.  I thought it came out a little thick and my boyfriend wanted more bacon, but those were the only complaints.",2,2,positive
"This is an excellent recipe. The only modifications that I made were: I used 1 cup of sugar (instead of 2 cups), I used five very ripe bananas (instead of about 4), I used 1 cup of walnuts (instead of 2 cups of pecans). I also waited a good 10-15 minutes for the loaves to cool down before putting the glaze over them, as some reviewers have mentioned it made a huge difference. I am planning on bringing one loaf to work on Monday. Let&#39;s spread the joy! :-) Delicious!",2,2,positive

Made it the first time as written, then for our taste the only thing I did different was decrease cumin to 1 tsp and a pinch and increase chili powder to 1/2 tsp and a pinch.  That&#39;s it!  I have used this for beef also but for beef use 1 Tbsp lemon and 1 Tbsp lime juice.  Absolutely the BEST homemade fajitas!!",2,2,positive

"IF YOU HAVE A SERIOUS SWEET TOOTH:
I didn’t enjoy the horseradish flavor. Just a personal preference, but next time I’ll use mayo instead. I doubled the sauce &amp; used a pkg of 8 sweet rolls. I had to put 2 of them in a pan all by themselves, which turned out to be a happy accident because it left more space around them for the sauce to caramelize so when you cut to separate them, more of the thin, crispy-chewy sauce stuck around the edges. So you got more of the savory-sweet chewy toffee for each sandwich. Next time I make them, I’ll bake fewer in each pan so this will happen to all of them.",2,1,neutral

I found starting at 400 for 40 minutes and then dropping the temp to 300 in a convection oven for 90 minutes to be successful.  The cheese bechamel is still holding and the potatoes are cooked as far as I can tell using a toothpick to test the softness. Feel free to add your own touches to make this dish your own.

The broth was pretty thin so I added 4 additional tablespoons of flower  mixed it with the broth and added back into the soup.  That thickened it up.  The taste was a little bland but still good.

I would agree with everyone else that the zucchini needs about 20 min to drain and I took handfuls and squeezed it out and had no problems.  Will be making again soon!!",2,2,positive
"Years ago I obtained this recipe from one of the Taste of Home magazines that I received on a monthly basis.  From the first time I baked this cake and made this icing I have never selected another chocolate cake recipe.  I have used other icings, like cream cheese frosting, which is also delicious on it.  I have made this over and over for friends and family and have always been told it is the most wonderful and delicious cake they&#39;ve ever tasted.  Once I made it and took it to a church social and it was chosen to be auctioned off to church members to raise money for the young people.  It was a lot of fun to see people bidding for it and it sold for a great price as they all knew it was wonderfully delicious!  I&#39;ve been asked for the recipe by many family members and friends.  I have never had this recipe to fail when I made it.  I love it!",2,2,positive

"This is my “go to” birthday cake for our whole family.  It has never failed!  It is ALWAYS so moist. It does not have a “coffee” taste, in case someone is curious; it is not “overly” chocolate, but just right.  I’ve doubled it before when making my kids multi-layered, multi-shaped birthday cakes. Everyone always complements it!! I have made the frosting listed in the recipe, but have made other “favorite” frostings instead, too, mostly because I don’t use shortening. I use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly. Someone said the center comes out raw....the recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is. However, it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time. I typically average a few extra minutes and it’s perfect!!! It also does freeze great, without frosting. When I’m making shaped birthday cakes, I freeze my cut-off extra pieces as I’m layering and then take them out for a later day. Sometimes, I frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving, but not always. They’re great without it too.",2,2,positive

The second time I made it today I changed one thing, I halved the amount of nuts and added dark chocolate chips for the other half. It also was exceptionally delicious. The original recipe is so moist and light, not oily and mushy like a lot of recipes. Thank you so much for another of your recipes.

I&#39;m not sure how this is lower-fat but they are definately yummy. My whole family loved these chewy cookies. I only got 3 dozen cookies instead of the 7 the recipe suggests so the recipe cookies must be bite-size cookies. YUMMY-YUMMY!!!,2,2,positive
"This chili is great. The only changes I made: I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half &amp; half and added 2 extra cans of green chilis. My family really liked it but my son (who doesn&#39;t like sour cream) thought the sour cream flavor was too strong so next time I will cut the sour cream in half. This recipe is definitely a keeper.",2,2,positive
This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made and it is definitely the one I make most often. I made this for an office party and now I am not allowed to bring anything else. It has been a hit wherever I take it. It is somewhat time-consuming so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to finish. Cooling completely before refrigeration is key. It really is as good as it looks.,0,2,positive

I like the recipe but I think it is too moist. I made it with 4 large bananas and felt it was going to be like soup. I added a 1/2 cup extra flour and it was still a little too moist for me. But my guests said it was very good and didn&#39;t know it was GF. Also I mixed the nuts in.,1,1,neutral

"This was absolutely delicious! I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I marinated for 2 hrs and the chicken was really tender when I threw it in the pan. I know this should be common sense, but be sure to mix the marinade up in the baggy before adding the chicken so it distributes evenly. If you use hot Mexican chili powder use far less than the recipe states! Super spicy. I added mango slices to the pan toward the end of cooking time and added avocado and tomato on top of my tortilla. Mmmmm mango.",2,2,positive

It makes quite a bit, so we refridged the remainder, reheated it next day at lunch and took the rest to our pastor and wife who were travelling.  Everyone was delighted with it.  Tonight,  I am making it again for family that is coming to dinner.I did do one extra item for this meal though.  I added a CAN of Hunt&#39;s spaghetti sauce with the tomatoes and about a 1/4 of a teaspoon of thyme to boot.  MMMMM good stuff, this.",2,2,positive

It did take a little longer to bake but the awful part was while baking in two 9&#34; pans the batter ran over the top and I had a huge mess in the bottom of the open.  I would have to have put it in two 8&#34; pans.  When I make this again, I will definitely use a 13 x 9 x 2&#34; pan.",2,0,negative
"This pie was such a hit at Thanksgiving that I decided to make it again for Christmas.  I did and the results were disappointing to say the least.  Neither pie set correctly--they came out unbelievably runny.  Then I stumbled across a review of this recipe from jiminy97 on Feb. 03, 2012.  They had the same results as my Christmas fiasco--runny pies.  The only thing we did alike was make 2 at the same time.  My guess is &#34;for best results--prepare 1 pie at a time&#34; should be added to the recipe.",2,2,positive

"I made a few changes to this soup to accommodate what I had on hand. It was super easy and delicious! I&#39;m not a fan of sausage so I omitted that. I added sweet peppers to the onion. And used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also didn&#39;t have fresh spinach so I thawed some frozen spinach, squeezed it and crumbled that in. I would definitely make this again. The red pepper flakes gave it a hint of spice and the parmesan cheese on top was a nice finishing touch.",2,2,positive
Great recipe - I use full fat half and half and less than 1/4 c of flour.  I have tried it with and without bacon crumbles.  Instead of the chicken bouillon I use &#34;Better Than Bouillon&#34; both chicken and the lobster type. Because I am using regular half and half I don&#39;t add it until the potatoes are done and heat through well so cream does not separate.,2,2,positive
"I have made this multiple times. The first few times I made it I only used 2 cans of chicken broth and substituted tomato puree or paste for the canned tomatoes.  This recipe is a little tricky just because if you don&#39;t have a good balance of spice, the pumpkin can be a little funky if you&#39;re not a huge pumpkin fan. My family really likes it, and overall they are generally picky eaters.",2,2,positive

I was disappointed in this bread.  I wonder if the 1 tablespoon of salt is correct - I don&#39;t think I have ever added 1 tablespoon of salt to anything I have made.   I thought this bread tasted too salty.  I didn&#39;t have canola oil so I used olive oil and  sprayed the pans with Pam - not sure if those things had anything to do with the salty taste.  I will not be making this again.,0,1,neutral

"Made this soup today since hubby is under the weather. This soup was excellent! I did make a few changes. First, I doubled the recipe to make a nice size pot. I omitted the celery seed as DH does not like it, but I minced a small rib of celery and cooked it with the potatoes and other veggies. Instead of doubling the parsley flakes, I added 1Tbsp. dried parsley flakes and 1 Tbsp dried minced chives. I added equal amounts of melted margarine with the flour in a separate pot, then added the milk and cheese to make a cheese sauce. Once that was all thickened and cheesy, I added it to the potato/veggie mixture. It was great, and I will make it again!",2,2,positive
The best apple pie I have ever eaten!!!,2,2,positive

"I&#39;ve used this recipe a number of times and it is always a crowd pleaser. It is packed with protien and perfectly filling. I add 1 cup of cooked brown rice and 1 can of mexicorn (you can find it at most grocery stores, its a mix of corn and red and green bell peppers). I usually double the recipe because it is so popular and when I do, I like to sub out one of the cans of white kidney bean (left whole) with a can of red kidney beans for some more color. These modifications keep it healthy as well as add a little more hardiness to the dish. I will always have this one in my recipe box! LOVE IT!",2,2,positive

"I use a similar recipe for icing, but use 1 cup butter instead of the butter/shortening mix, 4 T. flour. everything else the same. If you beat the butter and sugar well, it shouldn&#39;t taste grainy. We really like it because it isn&#39;t as sweet as regular butter-cream frosting.",2,2,positive
"Wonderful!  We both loved this dish.  I did not modify the ingredients, but I did make it with one pan...Cook the pork chops in oven proof pan and take out of pan, add the flour to the chicken broth and pour it into the pan, add the potatoes (I added sliced carrots) and cooked for 1 hour covered and 1/2 hour uncovered.  Delicious!  And only one pan.",0,2,positive

Topped with additional sprinkle of cheese. Amazing. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It will be a favorite in this family forever!",2,2,positive
"We make this almost weekly in our house; we love to use it for lunches for the week. I try to always have the ingredients on hand, but the best thing about this recipe is that you can easily alter it, and it&#39;s still good. We use Wegman&#39;s chicken sausage in various flavors (usually mild italian and sundried tomato and basil), and if I don&#39;t have fresh garlic, garlic powder works fine. I also use frozen cut leaf spinach instead of fresh. It always turns out great, even when I double the recipe!",2,2,positive

"Followed recipe exactly and first time using this recipe.  I was very disappointed in how it turned out - did not raise and edges burned even tho&#39; I thought it a good idea to loosely cover with foil once I saw the edges browning.  This was supposed to be a gift but could not in good conscience, give it to anyone.  Have not tasted it yet ....But in the future, will go back to my reliable stand-by recipe (which I thought was lost but have since found) as something is not quite right with this one.",1,1,neutral
A little salty for me but hubby really liked it.,2,2,positive
"I made this just as the recipe called, except used a generous teaspoon of chopped  fresh oregano because I have an abundance of it in my garden.  I also used the thinner fetticini noodles because my husband hates angel hair pasta.  The recipe was fabulous and will definitely be making this the next time all my children are home.",2,2,positive
"I have to agree with you, Mel7445. This soup is totally awesome. I&#39;ve made it several times, but just recently found out that I shouldn&#39;t have much dairy:(. I really want to make it, but just not sure what to do.",2,2,positive
"This was so delicious!!! The combination of chocolate and strawberry is amazing and I got many compliments on it! The only problem I had was with the chocolate garnishes, I got them made and on the cake but they got all droopy and wouldn&#39;t stay up after only a couple minutes. Also if you make this in advance I would follow GeorgeAnne&#39;s advice about dipping the strawberries first because I didn&#39;t and they did leak onto the frosting, but it was still delicious :)",2,2,positive
"My very picky family is already asking when I will make this again. I did tweak the recipe, in part because of personal preference but also because I used what I had on hand. I used about 4lbs of boneless skinless thighs. Following the advice of other reviewers, I used brown sugar instead of white. I also added honey and grated some ginger into the mixture. I substituted rice vinegar for apple cider vinegar and cooked on low in the crockpot for just under 3 hours.  Also, I found that I needed to double the cornstarch mixture at the end to get a good thickness. Served over quinoa and steamed broccoli and it was a big hit.",2,2,positive
My 12 year old son loves this delicious dish. He likes the honey grilled shrimp better though.,2,2,positive

"This moist, flavorful chicken was a big hit!  I will definitely be using this recipe again!",2,2,positive
Wow!! I just made this and can&#39;t stress to you how delicious this was. I adjusted the recipe because I didn&#39;t have 3 lbs of chicken. I had less than 2 lbs so I reduced the amount it called for by half. I also didn&#39;t use the low sodium soy sauce since I didn&#39;t have any on hand. I just used the regular and it tasted fine so I&#39;m not sure why everyone commented on how salty it was. Must try!,2,2,positive
"I am trying to find a new favorite chewy oatmeal cookie, this one is pretty good.  I was curious about the affect of the instant vanilla pudding..  The cookies seem pretty sweet, I will probably try them again by the recipe and see if they are the same.  I didn&#39;t add the nuts and I thought my dough was a little dry, but the chewy factor is there.  They don&#39;t flatten much so I kind of pushed them down when they came out of the oven.  It&#39;s a keeper for sure.",2,2,positive

"This is a great recipe! Since my husband is vegetarian, I used &#34;bacon flavored&#34; olive oil to saute the onion and carrots. Then I used veggie bullion instead of chicken and replaced the ham with sliced Litelife Italian sausage. My entire family actually prefers the veggie version :)",2,2,positive

Next time, I will use the soup as a sauce for chicken breast (minus the carrots, the cubed cooked chicken and wild rice on the side), as its consistency, smoothness and delicate flavor could easily make this a great sauce for a main dish.",2,2,positive
Wow this was yummy and yes I licked my bowl out LOL.  I did how ever make a few changes because I&#39;m watching my diet and it was still yummy.  I didn&#39;t put the sour cream in it instead I used plain greek yogert.  Also I didn&#39;t have garlic powder but I did have some garlic so i crushed up 3 cloves. I also used 1% milk not whipping cream and I put two cans of bean in and blended up one can of beans so it would be thicker.   Left overs were even better today!,0,2,positive

My daughter and I just made these.  Delicious!  I don&#39;t have a 10 X 15 pan so I used a 9 X 13 and baked a little longer.

The cake is similar to a pound cake, but not quite.  I sprinkled it with confectioners sugar and will be serving it with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  Next time I will try making cupcakes.  I&#39;ll let you know if it doesn&#39;t work, but I have a feeling it will.</p>",2,2,positive

I&#39;m a free-spirit when it comes to cooking, but baking requires a different approach. I&#39;m astounded that 144 people have had wonderful results, while I&#39;m still trying to figure out which type of cornmeal to use. I&#39;ve read all the comments and have only seen one reference to grind - Priscilla saying coarse grind may have made it grittier. (Thank you, Priscilla!)

"I found this in TOH  Ultimate cookie collection cookbook. (pg 81).   THESE ARE FANTASTIC! the ONLY thing i do a lil different is i add some chopped pecans to them mix before baking!  AWESOME WITH OR WITHOUT.  so soft and moist!  i noticed another reader asked, and i will say i did NOT beat my eggwhites previous to putting them in the bowl. i simply mixed it EXACTLY how the directions say.  i used medium speed on a stand mixer for a couple minutes till it looked good.  if you let the mix sit for too long, though, make sure you stir it before spooning them out as the sugar and liquid tends to sit on the bottom of the bowl.  also, my cookies did have some liquid spreading but it was GOOD STUFF.  i baked them till they were VERY lightly brown on top and golden brown at the very bottom edge.  i used parchment paper and never greased it once, and used it for a quadruple batch... as i make my cookies bigger than everyone else, i found this recipe didnt make many cookes.

This turned out great! I did a few swap outs, because teenager 🙄😑 I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I 100% recommend putting soup over your rice, or grain of choice. I have made a few different versions over the years and found out (I’d say kind of the hard way) the first time I made it to separate the grain and soup!

I made this cake for my sister-in-law&#39;s b-day. I only used cake recipe, because I made a chocolate-covered strawberries cake. I made a chocolate pudding filling with left over strawberries. The frosting I made a cocoa whipped cream one. Then placed almonds on the side of the cake.",2,2,positive
This white chili is excellent!  I found this recipe in a Maine newspaper while on vacation many many years ago and clipped it out to take home to Virginia and try.  It was a big hit and since then we have won 1st Place in many Chili contests over the other traditional red chili&#39;s.  The men at my husbands work ask for me to make this every year when winter rolls around as a treat.  Definitely a keeper to impress the boss or anyone.,2,2,positive

"Love this recipe! I did make a couple changes, I added carrots when cooking the onions, and I used canned tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion ( included the juices) I also included a bag of frozen green beans before adding the spinach and tortellini.

I just made this amazing bread and it tastes great!  I only needed 5.5 cups of flour and it still came out quite dense.  I baked in the oven one level up from the bottom with a cookie sheet on the bottom level.  This keeps the bottom from getting too burnt.It came out looking exactly like the picture.  My kids love it too!  This is great cause I hate breadmakers since the belt eventually slips on them and they make more noise.  Now I can make bread with no preservatives!,2,2,positive

"I don’t know where this recipe originated, but I double checked, it‘s EXACTLY the same one I have been making for forty years! It’s moist, it’s delicious. Some folks have commented that it’s not chewy. No, it’s not. It’s not supposed to be. It’s not exactly a cake either. It cuts into neat bars, my family loves them. I bake it in a 10x15 x 1 pan, it comes out perfectly. The only thing I add is a pinch of cloves. Delicious and reliable.",2,2,positive
"This pot raost was amazing!!! It was so tender and FLAVORFUL! I also thickened the juices to make the gravy. My family of 4 was sad to find out there wasn&#39;t enough for seconds.

"I really enjoyed making this pie today. It was sweet and spiced just right. It made a hit with the family and was truly a snap to make. I did cheat by using a good quality frozen crust, I beat my egg white nicely and brushed a good bit all over the crust and then gave it a generous sprinkling of sugar. My top crust was made by using a maple leaf cookie cutter stamp and just covering the entire top of the pie with leaves. I just love how pretty it makes the pie! Just beautiful for Fall! This recipe is a keeper! Thank You!",2,2,positive
"I love this recipe, although one time I made the mistake of adding jalapenos (cans were virtually identical) instead of the chilies which made it way too hot for my taste, but the rest of the group loves spicy food so it ended up working out!

"I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup plus a large can of broth.  I also cut up a couple of small red potatoes (sometimes I used diced hash browns) plus chopped onions.  My final addition is once I add the dumplings, I gently stir in a handful of frozen peas.  My family requests this recipe often during the winter months.",2,2,positive

"This recipe was easy to make and tasty, however I found it very bland. I was worried when preparing it that it would be, but wasn&#39;t sure if the saltiness of the bacon would be enough, so I didn&#39;t alter the recipe except to make it with 10 eggs. After eating it, I would definitely add salt and pepper, and maybe even some green and red peppers. It has the potential to be a wonderful recipe.",1,1,neutral
"This is basically the Weight Watchers Taco Soup recipe. I use ground turkey (healthier) and more beans, and throw in a dried chipotle pepper to make it more like chili than soup. I also do not add the can of stewed tomatoes, just two cans of the tomatoes with green chilies.",2,0,negative
This was just ok. The sauce was watery from the frozen raviolis and they were doughy. My husband who  loves lasagna couldn’t eat this. I reheated the next day and the sauce was less watery and the taste was slightly improved but I will not be making this again.,0,1,neutral
Very good!  My whole family loved it and told me repeatedly that I will need to make this again.  I did put 3/4 c of the salsa on the bottom of the pan as was suggested and I also stirred in the sour cream with the meat and beans.  I loved how easy it was to serve (not having to add salsa or sour cream on the plate).,2,2,positive

Next time I will double the recipe for a family of five. Even my picky kids gobbled them down! The chicken just fell off the bones.   The sweet and sour and spices were just perfect. I was worried the pepper flakes would make it too spicy, but it just added the right amount of flavor.   My kids want me to make this again!",2,2,positive

So after the chicken, onions and garlic (I used fresh garlic) were cooked I added two TBSP of flour and all the seasonings to the pot, stirred it in to coat the meat and let it cook for a couple minutes. Then I added the broth, chiles and three cans of beans. Finally I replaced the sour cream and whipping cream with cream cheese. SO Yummy!",2,2,positive

"Usually I don&#39;t condone reviewing a recipe if I have adjusted it in any way, but this one is so adaptable, I decided to go ahead. I helped my son make this. We only had 2 bananas so we halved the recipe and swapped out canola for coconut oil. More calories, but everyone is saying it&#39;s good for autism so I am having him use it whenever possible.

But other then that I fallowed the recipe as is except in the end, I didnt need the cornstarch, it had cooked down and thickened so well on its own that no more thickening was needed.  Someone posted about keeping this handy in the fridge, I agree 100%. Never again will I purchase teriyaki sauce. I can see this sauce replacing several I keep on hand, and I can see using it in oh so many various ways, to many to mention. Thank you Mr. Dave Farrington, of Midwest City, Oklahoma for this recipe.

Great recipe! Fast and delicious.  My 6 year old loves it and he is a tough critic. Btw I used both sweet and spicy sausage.,2,2,positive
"OMG this is a great cake! I don&#39;t bake much, but decided this looked easy and I had the Guinness anyway.  Boy am I glad that I saw this recipe. Hubby asked if we could just make this enough that we have it to eat every day, all the time LOL  I don&#39;t have a spring form pan, so I made it in a 8x8 and it turned out great.",2,2,positive
I cut this recipe in half as I only had one can of pie filling.  Used 9x9 pan.  Took roughly 45 minutes to bake but turned out like a cherry danish.  Really good!  I&#39;ll make it again.,2,2,positive
Fabulous!  I didn&#39;t change a thing!  I put whipped topping and fresh strawberries on top.  My husband LOVED it!  Thank you!,2,2,positive
"Mmmmm....needs more cheese tho...wonderful, cheap and quick.",2,2,positive
Just made this following the recipe with no modifications. The bread is awesome.  Could not tell that it was gf. Next time I plan to  substitute part of the sugar for stevia.,2,2,positive
I change out black beans for pinto beans and omitted the Clintro as we don&#39;t care for it.,1,2,positive
"Got many rave reviews on this cake. Wasn&#39;t so sure that it was going to be so great because I thought that the cake was dense and that their was too much butter in the frosting, but after it was all put together and chilled in the fridge, it was excellent.",2,2,positive
We just made this again and it is so good! We used a different kind of noodle and just put some sour cream in our own bowls instead of the pan. SOOO good!!,2,2,positive
This was very good.  Will be making again very soon.  Thank you for such a great recipe.,2,2,positive
"MMmmMMmmMMmmmm....  I love coming home to this scrumptious lasagna after weekend errands.  At one time, I did have some of the tomato ingredients so I substituted the sauce ingredients for a can of spaghetti sauce, and it still came out just as amazing.  Good stuff!!!",2,2,positive
I’ve made this several times and it’s always a hit.I use bulk sausage in place of the bacon. Just my preference.Definitely one of my favorite go to recipes for an easy and tasty breakfast or brunch dish.,2,2,positive
Easy and it was the best,2,2,positive
"This turned out very good, I have made it twice. I did use broth instead of bullion. Very easy to make.",2,2,positive
"Tasted great! I used a 9x13 pan due to the small size of my oven so the sweet icing was a little overpowering, but still good.",2,2,positive
"Quick, easy and yummy.  This recipe turns out just the way it&#39;s supposed to.",0,2,positive
"Thank you for sharing this recipe, I’m so glad I saw it and tried it!! I made it for our Sunday dinner. It is simple to make, but delicious, and tastes like you spent hours. What a win-win! Everything about it was perfect, and best of all my husband was very complimentary!! We will definitely add this to our dinner line-up!!!!",2,2,positive
I&#39;ve taken this to potlucks and always get rave reviews on it and requests for the recipe.  I love it!,2,2,positive
"I thought the tomato base tasted on the bland side. So, like one of the reviewers, I added a couple dashes of garlic powder when browning the ground beef, which definately zips it up, plus, I added about 3-4 dashes of worcestershire sauce, and 3 shakes of cayenne pepper to the soup. This recipe is easily customizable to your family&#39;s taste buds! I will definately add to my recipe file! Thanks!",2,2,positive
I made this to try to make us feel better about having a lonely COVID ( no children or grandchildren) Christmas dinner. It was delicious and so easy. Hubby hates lemon so I just made the garlic butter sauce and used thin spaghetti since we didn’t have angel hair pasta. I will be making this many times!,2,2,positive
this is such a delicious cake and so easy to make!  :),2,2,positive
I&#39;ve made this before and it&#39;s really good.  I updated it after awhile though because my husband likes thick soups so I add a can of refried beans in the mix.,2,2,positive
Love this soup It is my kids favorite.  I even had to write it down for my son when he got married.,2,2,positive
This is the best cake I have ever had. The ingredients are simple and readily available. Recipe is easy to make.,2,2,positive
"Definitely will make again, followed recipe with exception of adding hot pepper flakes instead of cayenne.  Really liked the hint  of smoked flavor off the sausages.",2,2,positive
I made this for New Year&#39;s Day dinner and it was a hit! This will be my go to recipe for lasagna. I had Italian sausage so used that instead of the pork sausage and it turned out great.,2,2,positive
"So full of flavor!    I double the amount of cheese, onions and hamburger...",2,2,positive
"I made it without the shrimp and it was very good.  It&#39;s just spicy enough and really good over rice.  I did cook it on high, though, b/c I thought 4 hrs on low might not be enough to cook the vegetables.  At 4 hrs on high, everything was cooked but not mushy.",0,2,positive
I made this soup tonight for my family.  I used  pkg shredded cheese instead of velveeta.  And took the bacon out of pan after I cooked it. And served it on top of soup as a garnish.  Everyone loved it.  This is a keeper.  Thank you for the receipe.,2,2,positive
"It was way too sweet.  I could taste the brown sugar.  May try again, but will cut down on both the white and brown sugars.",2,1,neutral
"We loved this tasty and easy recipe. I made a few changes to the original recipe which I would recommend.  I added chopped green onions, oregano, parsley and onion powder to the bruschetta as well as more olive oil.  When preparing the chicken, I rolled the chicken in the flour, egg and then rolled it in the parmesan and bread crumbs.  I baked it uncovered for about 45 minutes.  It was so yummy.",2,2,positive
I was really disappointed. After reading many of the reviews I decided to make this recipe. It is the worst banana nut bread recipe I&#39;ve made. I really have no idea how it was a contest winning recipe. :(,0,1,neutral
"Hello, 
I made this chunky Apple cake last family party. It was a huge hit, the cake, the sauce OMG was really really good. I’ll keep making this for special events. 

Thank you so much.",2,2,positive
"Used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of a half cup onion to accommodate my husband&#39;s preferences.  And added a healthy sprinkle of cayenne.  Was worried it would be salty, but it was not.  Next time I may opt for salt substitute or a blend.",2,1,neutral
"To add to my review--I didn&#39;t have vanilla pudding mix, but I did have cheesecake pudding mix.  So I used this instead.  Very good.",2,2,positive
THIS WAS FABULOUS!,2,2,positive
This is hands down the best banana bread I have ever eaten or made. It is my new go-to recipe (since last year). I get many and often requests at church to bring it to any get-together and to make it for bakesales. Amazing!,2,2,positive

"My son with minimal cooking experience took the initiative to make supper one night. Lucky for us he found this recipe. Fantastic! Better than any fajitas I have ever had. Because he enjoys peppers, he used a whole pepper (red &amp; green) rather than just half as suggested.  I&#39;m am surprising him tomro, just finished prep work and marinating in basement fridge. Only need fresh guacamole and a little cilantro and we&#39;re set! Very happy Daddy!",2,2,positive
This was really good! I was skeptical with the orange juice because I have had bad experiences in the past but it was delicious! Also the crushed red pepper was perfect my husband is pretty sensitive to spice and he didn&#39;t even notice! I used breasts instead of thighs just because that&#39;s what I had on hand! Excellent and easy.,2,2,positive
My man loved this dessert. Was easy to make and tastes great.,2,2,positive
"I made these today , it’s wonderful !  Didn’t change a thing, I added cinnamon because  I thought the recipe called for it !  I love banana cake, bars, bread, this is terrific!!’",2,2,positive
"Wow, Susan, that is so rude to rate a recipe that you didn’t even bother to try because you are some kind of lasagna snob.  If the recipe is “beneath your standards”, just pass on by and find recipes more to your liking.  Some of us are more interested in the food than in the tradition you use to make YOUR lasagna.",2,0,negative
I only wish that it wasn&#39;t so full of fat and calories--is there any way you can do a recipe make-over on this one?  I LOVE it but can&#39;t enjoy as often as I&#39;d like due to the high calorie/fat content.,2,0,negative
"Made this recipe for the first time tonight, turned out great, I did use chicken broth instead of bullion and water and blended the veggies up before adding the cheese sauce. My picky 1 and 3 year olds devoured it, will be making it again.",2,2,positive
I didn&#39;t like the sauce.  I might try it again using brown sugar.,1,1,neutral
Very good! Family enjoyed it but suggest just a tad of heat added and only cook for 3 hours. thanks!,2,2,positive
This recipe was absolutely fabulous!,2,2,positive
Incredibly good.,2,2,positive
My whole family loves this dish and every time i make it for company they always rave about it. So easy and deff something that can be altered to fit personal tast. I have made it many time and i am sure i will make it many more times to come!,2,2,positive

"Loved this recipe. Made it for my husband&#39;s poker buddies. They gobbled it up! I did use more sour cream than called for but that only made the dish more creamy. Used a little more Mexican blend cheese than called for. I did add the Italian dressing and didn&#39;t see that it altered the dish adversely.  I will definitely make this dish again. Served shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, guacamole and extra salsa on the side. Also  served a corn salad which was made ahead.",2,2,positive
I have Celiac so finding cream soups that don&#39;t contain flour is next to impossible. I used cornstarch instead of flour and I will never buy any other mushroom soup. This can be used for anything and I absolutely love it.,2,2,positive

"The very best Banana Bread.  When I make it now I reduce the amount of sugar, and instead of all white flour I substitute 1 cup white flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and it is even better with less calories.",2,2,positive
These pancake are perfect to wake up to. We always double or triple the recipe so there&#39;s plenty for everyone!!,2,2,positive
"Very easy recipe. The taste was excellent. Made it for friends and they loved it! I didn&#39;t use a deep dish pie crust, I used a graham cracker pie crust because its my fav with cheesecake, and pecan pie. Because I didn&#39;t use a deep dish pie crust I used less caramel than the recipe called for, maybe 2/3 of it was used. My pie still came out like the pic and maybe even better! The one problem I did have with the recipe is the timing to leave the pie in the oven. The recipe stated 35mins. But my pie was still not done in the middle so I left it for an additional 15 mins. or so and it came out perfect with the golden brown crust. YUMMY!!",2,2,positive
"Excellent layers of flavor. I didn&#39;t make this in a crock pot because there wasn&#39;t time. I sauted all of the vegies in olive oil first, added the spices except I used paprika instead of cayenne because my husband has acid issues, I added 2 Tbl of Cumin and 2 Tbl crushed Bay Leaves, browned chicken and sausages, added to mix, brought to bowl in dutch oven and simmered for 45 minutes, then added the shrimp and simmered 15 more minutes.  Flavors were layered and distinct. Will add this to my Chef&#39;s List and serve with confidence to my clients.",1,2,positive
This recipe was really delicious.  My family loved it!!  I wouldn&#39;t change a thing about it.,2,2,positive
This is delicious! I didn&#39;t add the nutmeg or cloves (none on hand) but did add raisins.,2,2,positive
The only thing I did different was double the spices and add poultry seasoning.  It was so tasty!  Absolutely will make again!,2,2,positive
I made this to bring to my monthly book group meeting and it was delicious! My daughter and mom tried it before I brought it and raved. (I cut into bars on a plate before bringing it). Everyone enjoyed it.,2,2,positive
Easy to make and just as tasty as the store bought candy.,2,2,positive
For those that complain about hard rice... what beef are you using 80/20 ... 90/10?? The rice takes on moisture from the meat to expand.... so don&#39;t be too lean on the burger!  This could be the issue!,0,0,negative
"I love it ,will try it again thanks for the awesome recipy",2,2,positive
The best banana nut bread ever! The only change that I made was the nuts. I put the whole cup in the batter but didn&#39;t put any on the top until I  glazed the loaves and then I only sprinkled a few. Utterly delicious******,2,2,positive
You&#39;ll never want another kind of meatloaf again!  And it&#39;s easy to make.,2,2,positive
Very easy and healthy.  I agree with previous reviews that it needed extra spices.  I added a lot more chili powder and some cayenne pepper.  Then it was delish!,2,2,positive
Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it and will definitely be making it again.,2,2,positive
"Not only is this recipe simple, it is absolutely fabulous. These home made cupcakes come out perfect every time, with just the right amount of spice. The are moist and delish!  The icing is the perfect compliment to these tasty morsels... I will make them again and again.",2,2,positive

"This was a good recipe. Different from one my mom made but better. I omitted the brown sugar because I thought it would be too sweet.  I noticed some comments indicating that the water made meatballs too mushy. The water isn&#39;t supposed to be added to the meat mixture, but with the sauce- after the meatballs have been browned.",2,2,positive

"Love this bread! My wife and family also love this delicious sandwich bread. Definitely doesn&#39;t require all of the flour. I used around 5 cups. Everything else is spot on though. To quote Holly- I felt like an instant bread expert. I have already made this recipe 2xs. The first time with all purpose flour, came out dry and spongy. The second time I used baking flour, and the bread was perfect. Crisp yet chewy. Thank you.",2,2,positive

"This was fantastic!  The broth is SO flavorful.  A little bit spicy for the kids, but that&#39;s easy to dial back.  I will definitely make this again",2,2,positive
"This recipe turned out great! I just made it for thanksgiving. I did add an extra tbsp of flour as other reviewers advised, and the results were not runny at all, or dry. Also for the sugar I let my half cups measures be slightly short, and it didn&#39;t turn out too sweet. Also for the ginger, instead of powder I used paste and slightly more since its fresh. I used 4 granny Smith, and 2 honeycrisp apples. The results were fabulous. I&#39;ve made apple pie in the past using recipes found here or there and the flavor was always missing something. I&#39;m not sure if it is the use of ginger, or that I use ceylon cinnamon, but this recipe is a keeper.",2,2,positive
We make this banana bread all the time.  It is by far our favorite.  We use less pecans though because I don&#39;t care for them (maybe 1/4 cup total?) and we haven&#39;t actually tried it with the glaze yet.,2,2,positive
This is perhaps one of my most favorite recipes.  The flavor is outstanding...and the leftovers are so versatile!  I use the leftover chicken in my homemade fried rice. I double the recipe and quadruple the sauce.,2,2,positive
A great recipe! They came out beautifully!! Will use recipe again.,2,2,positive
"Despite the 97 degree temperature, I made this because of all the peppers from our garden.  We thought it was a tasty soup.  I did add onion, garlic and Worcestershire sauce and substituted beef broth for the water.",2,2,positive
SO DELICIOUS!!! No other lasagna even comes close to this one.,2,2,positive
I get asked for this recipe all the time!,2,2,positive
The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the flavor of the sherry over powered the other tasty ingredients. I feel as though using the chicken broth would have been a better choice for me. Will be trying again.,1,2,positive
Hands down the BEST chocolate cake we have ever made. My daughter and I made this as the centerpiece of our family holiday meal and it did not disappoint. The frosting is on the sweet side but it balances the cake.  We made the cake with coffee instead of water and it was wonderful.  First dessert to go on a well stocked dessert table :) This recipe is a keeper.,2,2,positive
"Very tasty.  I made the mistake however, in that I put too much broth in and it turned more into a soup then chili.  But it was still good and I will definitely try this again.",2,2,positive
"very good, i did make a couple of changes but not in the ingredients only in preparation. i cut up the thighs and poured the sauce over the pieces and baked them. there was !",2,2,positive
"I followed this recipe exactly.  I think people that have included in their review that the potatoes were not cooked enough did not interpret the recipe correctly.  I believe the recipe could be more clearly written that after you cook covered for 1 hour, you THEN remove the cover and cook for an ADDITIONAL 30-40 minutes.  That is plenty of time-- the potatoes were quite soft.  You DEFINITELY do NOT need to precook the potatoes first.  That is a waste of every working person&#39;s limited time.  Do be aware that you need to set aside AT LEAST TWO HOURS of time to prepare, cook, and cool this dish.   I liked it a lot but would add a bit more than the 1 cup of cheese the next time.",2,2,positive
"This dish was phenomenal!  Hubby and I both loved it!  The only change that I made was using tomato paste rather than ketchup, which was a kitchen tip.  I also, put the tomato paste before the peas and corn to let it cook out and develop flavor; then Worcestershire sauce and garlic stirring to incorporate before adding the vegetables.   I also divided in half:  Topped one with our Cheddar Mashed and Cheese and froze the other just the meat mixture so when we are ready to eat we just need to top with potatoes and cheese.",2,2,positive
easy recipe to follow. I used bread flour and weighted my flour and used rapid yeast. It raised beautifully both times. I also used my proof feature of my oven. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.,2,2,positive
I have made these a few times now and they are very good.  The cream cheese frosting is perfect!,2,2,positive
This is a great casserole for breakfast or any other meal!  It lends itself to being very adaptable. I used pepperjack and a little less cheese also. I have tried it with spicy Italian sausage and another time with diced Polish Kielbasa.  Always rave reviews from the peanut gallery!,2,2,positive
Super delicious! The only thing was I found was they burned really quickly. Didn&#39;t impact the flavour at all though. Served them with fresh made Strawberry Syrup from this site.,2,2,positive
"The results are fabulous, but I disagree with the submitter that it&#39;s &#34;a cinch to whip up because there&#39;s no baking involved&#34; - 4 bowls, two washes of the beaters, letting things set up, etc. - I could have whipped up a fantastic batch of brownies (which are baked) in about the same amount of time or less actually.  Just because you don&#39;t have to bake it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a cinch.",2,2,positive
"I have made many versions of potato soup, and this one is truly one of the best ever! This will definitely be on my winter soup list to make on a regular basis. I think it would also be great with leftover baked ham instead of bacon!",2,2,positive
"This is a fantastic dessert. I actually freeze it, so I can enjoy it longer.",2,2,positive
"Oh, my, this is good!  Nice and moist, with well-balanced banana flavor.  My kids said it rivaled carrot cake - which they love.  The cream cheese frosting rounds out the flavor.  Definitely a keeper recipe - and a great way to use up over-ripe bananas!",2,2,positive

I really thought I had reviewed but I didn&#39;t see it on here so I&#39;m reviewing it again, This is the best seafood lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. I have several family members from out of town who will call and ask if I will make this for them when they come to visit. It&#39;s a little time comsuming but well worth it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It&#39;s definitely a jewel!!!",2,2,positive

"I made this yesterday and followed the recipe exactly, except for adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the filling before adding the apples.  I used a glass pie pan and baked for 45 minutes.  It came out perfect.  The 1-1/2 cups for the topping was spot on.  I thought the apples could have cooked a little longer, I used Gala, next time I might try a different one.  I will  definitely be making this again.",2,2,positive
"The cake turned out well, but I think 2 cups of butter is too much butter--I now have chocolate soup chilling so I can ice this cake--thinking about only making the ganache instead.",1,2,positive
"Despite my relative novice level this turned out good! What made me select this recipe is the homemade bread tips that Taste of Home provided. I enjoyed the simplicity, which made the recipe more approachable. My first attempt was a fail and was completely my fault because I didn&#39;t check the expiration date on my yeast (which I knew after reading the Tips). The second attempt was so much better and gives me hope that I can get even better results. I didn&#39;t have bread flour so I just used regular all-purpose flour. My family enjoyed the bread as well!",2,2,positive
"I only used 1/3 cup of flour the second time I made this. It was delicious both times, but we like the filling a bit thinner. It’s definitely a new favorite in our house.",2,2,positive

"I made this tonight, and it was delicious.  I didn&#39;t have any sour cream but I had plain non fat greek yogurt, so I added that.  I used a full pound of hamburger, 4c of broth and 2c of milk so it would yield more servings for my family.  I also added some green onion at the end for garnish.  I also added broccoli and left out the celery because I didn&#39;t have any. Overall, this is a great soup and I will make it again!! Oh, and it wasn&#39;t too cheesy either!",2,2,positive

My very first time making bread and it came out great! I honestly don’t think I’m ever gonna buy store bought white bread again. It’s super easy and cheap to make. Mine was a little on the dense and salty side so maybe I’ll use a tad bit less salt but it’s still sooo good.,2,2,positive

"I read all the reviews first and then made this dish. I preboiled the potatoes after they were sliced, then used that pan to make the sauce to put over the potatoes. I seared the pork steaks in the iron skillet, moved them to a platter and arranged the potatoes and onions in the iron skillet and poured over the sauce. I put the pork steaks on top of the potatoes and baked this for 30 minutes covered. I removed the foil and baked it 15 more minutes. Everything was done and delicious. My family raved. I will make this again.",2,2,positive
"This recipe is so easy and delicious.  I also have used different varieties of jello/yogurts.  Key Lime is my favorite, but I like the orange dreamcycle also.  This dessest is so lite, you always have room for it.",2,2,positive
"okay -- did not have everything and needed something quicker but used as a starting point!  Made half the recipe and wanted to reduce time by dicing up 1 cup of small new potatoes from a can for starters..  added about a cup of fresh mushrooms diced up along with onions  to saute in butter.  Substituted 12 oz package of mixed veggies for all other veggies -- will use more next time.  Used over-flowing 2 cups of rotisserie chicken along with &#34;jell&#34; from drippings in container.  Mixed everything together along with 1/2 cup of sour cream and placed in 11x7 casserole dish and topped with Parmesan cheese and then small cut-outs from pie crust.  Oh, used Thyme &#34;leaves&#34; and it was all wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again -- and probably in the very near future!",2,2,positive
"Wow!  This is one of the best soups recipes I have ever made.  My daughter was so disappointed when it was gone that I ran out and bought more ingredients to make more.  I did modify slightly the second time around.  1 1/2 qts of chicken broth, 1/4 pound of mushrooms, and added some half and half at the end.  The half and half really made it much creamier.  So, so good!",2,2,positive
"These were probably the best thing I’ve ever made, and I’m a big baker.  I used about 1/3 more cinnamon, 1/3 less oil, and baked about 5 minutes longer...but ovens do vary.  Delish!",2,2,positive
We enjoy this recipe but felt the cheese content was too much so we use kraft cheese singles - about 10 slices and it still maintains the great flavor!,2,2,positive

oops...I meant to say &#34;whipping cream&#34; in my previous post!,2,0,negative
Very nice flavor.  The only problem I had was with the consistancy - it was more like soup than chili.,0,2,positive
Really enjoyed added gouda cheese. Made this again today but for some reason it came out griddy. Dont know what i did wrong but it didnt do it before and i have made it many times. So i still give it a five.,0,2,positive
This was delicious and so quick and easy to make with simple ingredients.  This is a keeper!,2,2,positive
"This is a fabulous recipe!  I&#39;ve made it at least a dozen times with no modifications and it is a hit every time.  I use frozen, uncooked and deveined shrimp when fresh isn&#39;t available.  Yummy!",2,2,positive
"I made this recipe three times all summer long and these are my observations.  First and foremost, if you follow my recommendations, you will not have any problems at all, despite what others say here.  What I did is use Reynolds (brand) Release Foil (make sure dull side is facing up) in the 10X15X1 pan.  MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH FOIL HANGING OVER THE SHORT ENDS TO LIFT THE COOKIES OUT OF THE PAN LATER.  I ALSO sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray very lightly.  I made sure all of the graham crackers fit properly in the pan (trim using a paring knife if need be--it&#39;s much easier than you think).  Once the crackers are in the pan properly, I did use more than two cups of mini marshmallows...probably 2-1/2 cups total--enough to cover all of the crackers sufficiently.  Then what I did is I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of light brown (not dark brown) sugar.  Make sure you use real butter and fresh brown sugar.  I cooked it precisely 1 minute after the butter melted.  I think what a lot of cooks are doing is cooking the butter and brown sugar mixture too long.  This will cause the cookies to not turn out like they are supposed to (I know from experience).  I used 1-1/2 teaspoons of GOOD cinnamon (like Penzey&#39;s Celyon) and good, double strength vanilla extract.  I also put a PINCH (no more) of salt in the caramel mixture.  When it is cooked, I transferred the entire caramel mixture into a Pyrex measuring cup and poured it very carefully over the marshmallows so nothing puddled.  Then I topped with the coconut and almonds and baked for 12 minutes and then checked it.  My oven tends to be a bit psychotic, so it only takes about one minute more in mine to brown.  When you take the cookies out of the oven, you will see that the marshmallows look like they are not cooked all the way.  Don&#39;t worry.  They will finish melting when you take them out of the oven.  Remove pan from oven and place on a towel on table or counter for five minutes.  Then lift cookies out by short ends with the foil overhang and place back on table or counter for five minutes or so (depends on temperature in your house at the time).  Then lightly spray a large pizza cutter with nonstick spray and use the pizza cutter to slice through the cookies--don&#39;t remove from pan right away--just slice.  Then let cool completely and put in a very loosely covered container.  They won&#39;t last long enough to go stale.  Not to worry.  People are having problems with these cookies because, I think, they are cooking the caramel way too long.  Even a minute too long is tooo long.  I hope this helps you guys so that you will try it--even try it again, if you didn&#39;t like the way they turned out the first time.  Happy baking!",2,2,positive
I have been making this very recipe since the &#34;70&#39;s&#34; and everyone loves it. Got it in the newspaper Detroit News.... the very best banana bread for sure.,0,2,positive
This is the most amazing soup!  I make it weekly in our household and for those fall &amp; winter potlucks.,2,2,positive
I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was delicious!  This was an easy meal to prepare and I will make it again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.,2,2,positive
WONDERFUL RECIPE!!!,2,2,positive
My husband loved this recipe...will definately make it again.,2,2,positive
Delicious!  Just the two of us and my husband almost ate the whole dish ! He said if he was at a party he&#39;d fill half his plate up with this salad. Very good.,2,2,positive
Definite Keeper!!! My family loved this soup and it will be made again.,2,2,positive

" Sorry I misread the calories, but still looking at the ingredients they are not as bad as some ingredients in cookies are. Lets face it gooood cookies are not going to be low in fat and good for us. So if we can at least cut some of the fat out that helps.",0,0,negative
"I used my houseguests as recipe raters on this and tried this out this morning. They thought it was very good. I had to bake it 10+ minutes longer than the recipe called for and that eliminated the mushy-bread-egg condition that sometimes comes with an overnight egg bake dish. I used Vienna bread and it was fine. My revisions for next time: leave the crusts on (that was time-consuming) and I may layer the top of the bread with thinner slices of cream cheese rather than the 1&#34; cubes. Not everyone around my breakfast table was a big fan of cream cheese chunks. I also thought that I might try using raspberries rather than blueberries to see how that goes. All in all, this was a very nice change from the usual french toast or egg back recipe!",2,2,positive
"This is a fantastic dessert to feed a crowd.  I was a bit skeptical of how thick my batter was to spread on the bottom of my pan, but it all baked up just fine!  These cut best for me after chilling slightly.  Delicious!",2,2,positive
"This was unfortunately horribly under seasoned.  I ended up adding more soy sauce, five spice seasoning, garlic salt, more soy sauce....you get the idea.  I really wanted to like it &amp; it&#39;s a decent starting place for veggies/noodles, but seasoning-wise ---I would not recommend.",0,1,neutral
"WOW! If you haven&#39;t tried this simple recipe then it&#39;s time you do. So easy to make and the flavor is amazing! The recipe itself is great,but like a couple of other reviewers I added a little bit of garlic powder and a splash of olive oil. Thank you for sharing Anne!",2,2,positive
Worst recipe ever. Did everything right I even triple checked the recipe and measurements. It came out as a huge gooey glob. Looks disgusting. Also stop using 3/4 measurements. Make a real recipe with real fkg measurements. Despicable.,0,0,negative
My family has brought this to picnics for years but this was the first time I tried making it. I kept finding my husband sneaking some of it at night—that’s how I knew how good it really was! Make sure you make time cooling between layers—it does help! But can be tedious. Way worth it!!,2,2,positive
"I made this as a Mothers Day breakfast for my sweetheart recently, she loved it and  everyone else loved it as well. I would most assuredly make this again, even for a normal weekend breakfast. Thank you very much for the recipe, LOVED it.",2,2,positive
Is a very tasty moist banana bread.,2,2,positive
"Really like this, make it very often. Hard to find whole water chestnuts so I use sliced and cut them in half.  I usually take the seeds out of the cucumbers with small scoop but probably not necessary.  This is great for pot lucks.",2,2,positive
Very tasty.  I added corn and some ranch dressing.,2,2,positive

"For a novice pie crafter, I and my coworkers raved about this recipe. Easy and unnaturally delicious.I used Granny Smith, Breaburn and Jonagolds for two pies, just enough tart and sweet and bulk for pie filling. I&#39;ll keep this for other times when apple pies are called for.",2,0,negative

"I lived in a small town in NJ when I was a child.  A quaint little place, there was one butcher&#39;s shop with sawdust on the floor and one bakery that had the most glorious display of goodies.  Of all their creations, I loved the macaroons the best.  Some memories never go away - you brought me back to the 1950s.. thank you.",2,2,positive
Ive made this recipe many times  in fact it&#39;s my husband&#39;s requested birthday meal every year . I make it just as recipe states because I believe if you adjust things you should rate a different recipe . The only ratings of THIS recipe should be BEFORE adjusting . 5 star perfect every time,2,2,positive
"I am awful at cooking, yet I found this recipe easy despite my challenges as a chef. Loved the flavor, so did my family. I did use the bacon grease that came out the bacon to sauté the onions then add the rest of the veggies.",2,0,negative
This is definitely a make again!  My family and I loved it.    Made exactly as directed and turned out perfect.  Everyone was disappointed when it was gone.,2,2,positive
"The day I made it I wasn&#39;t terribly impressed, but it was better the next day.  It gave the flavors time to &#34;marry&#34;.",2,2,positive
"I love Mexican dishes, and it is often difficult to find ones that my wife will tolerate.  The cilantro and the subtle flavor of the dressing made this a meal that she will most likely let me make again.  A dollop of sour cream would have probably made it even better.",2,2,positive

This really is the &#34;Best Ever&#34; banana bread I have ever made.  I had to substitute the buttermilk and by accident I used baking powder instead of baking soda but it still turned out wonderful.  Can&#39;t wait to make this again with the correct ingredients!,2,2,positive
"This was a perfect recipe for my son to make who is learning to cook.  He did it all himself following the well written directions.  It really was a tasty dish, and the presentation was lovely.  Son was quite proud of himself---even took a picture to email a friend!  I told him he will have to fix it again for Cinco de Mayo!  Thanks for sharing.",2,2,positive
Super easy and delicious! My daughter keep asking me to make this one again :D,2,2,positive
